// Pipeline::Registration - the `pipeline.registration` module.
//
// The pipeline's COMPOSITION ROOT as a library. Every host that cooks or imports - the CLI
// cooker, the export packager, the editor, the headless MCP server - needs the SAME set of
// builders, importers, and product/resource type registrations. Registering that set inline in
// each host's main() duplicates it verbatim; a builder added to two of three copies is a silent
// gap (cook works in the editor, missing from CLI export - the collision-cook class of bug).
// This library is the single source of truth: it links every pipeline module (its entire job -
// the deliberate fan-in point) and exposes three entry points the hosts call instead of
// restating the list.
//
// The wide imports live in the implementation unit, not here: this interface stays lean (three
// declarations + the tripwire counts) so the four hosts that consume it do not each pull the
// whole pipeline into their BMI (GCC module-interface hygiene).
