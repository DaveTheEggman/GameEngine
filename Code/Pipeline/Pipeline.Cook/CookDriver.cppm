// Pipeline::Cook - the `editor.cook` module.
//
// The incremental cook driver. One rule decides
// everything: an asset's RECIPE HASH = H(source envelope bytes, each source file's content,
// builder version, recipe of each content-READ dependency), folded ORDERED into a single u64 -
// dirty <=> product missing or hash mismatch. Deterministic across machines/checkouts (content
// hashes decide; stat (size,mtime) is only a memo to skip re-hashing untouched files, persisted
// in the pipeline DB at .cache/cook.db).
//
// Plan(): walk the source DB -> route instances to builders -> compute recipes (memoized file
// hashes, read-dep chaining with cycle guard) -> dirty set in dependency order + orphan sweep
// (records whose source is gone -> their products are deleted; Traktor's missing piece).
// Execute(): cook dirty items - parallel within dependency levels on the JobSystem - writing
// products into the cooked DB with PRODUCT GUID = SOURCE GUID (user-confirmed), then persist
// the pipeline DB. A failed build keeps the last good product and marks the record failed.
//
// The pipeline DB is one binary file, written whole through the cache mount; corruption or a
// version mismatch degrades to a full re-plan - never wrong output, only wasted work.
