// Editor::App - the `editor.app:tool_panel` partition.
//
// The viewport-tool PANEL seam (property-animation.md Phase H1). A viewport tool (editor.viewport-
// tools) is a UI-free modal interaction mode; some tools are also "modes" that want an on-screen
// settings surface docked beside the viewport while they are active - property-animation authoring,
// a future terrain-brush panel, a nav-mesh bake panel. That surface is UI (it builds ui::Views), so
// it CANNOT live on IViewportTool (the tool framework is deliberately UI-free, headless hosts link
// it). Instead this is a SECOND registry one layer up, in the editor-UI tier: UI-capable domain libs
// register an IViewportToolPanelProvider keyed by their tool's Id(); the scene page reserves a dock
// slot and, whenever the active tool changes, mounts the matching panel (or nothing).
//
// Navigation-ready by construction: the panel factory receives the SAME ViewportToolHostContext the
// tool did (scene + command stack + selection), and the panel's lifetime is ACTIVATION-SCOPED - the
// view is created on activate and dropped on deactivate, so durable edit state must live in the tool
// or its domain lib, never in the view. That keeps every panel safe to recreate and makes "add
// another mode" nothing more than "register another provider for another tool id".
