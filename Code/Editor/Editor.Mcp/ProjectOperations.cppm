// IProjectOperations: how a HOST runs the work behind asset_cook / asset_import / asset_create /
// project_export.
// The tools themselves are shared - their arguments, refusals and result shapes are the same on
// every host - but WHERE the work runs is the host's: the stdio host runs it inline on the
// calling thread (every step answers at once), the editor on its own background services (the
// cook service, the job service) with the tool re-entered each pump until they finish, so the
// editor never blocks on an agent's call. A step that is not finished is an EMPTY Optional; a
// refusal or failure is the error text the agent reads.
//
// Every operation is IDEMPOTENT ACROSS RE-ENTRIES: a not-finished tool is called again with
// the same arguments on the host's next pump, so the first call with a request starts the
// work and later calls with the same request poll it. An implementation keeps that state
// itself, and one operation of each kind is in flight at a time (the tool is one call).
