// Editor::Mcp - :scene_reference partition
//
// The scene format reference an agent authors scenes from (Documentation/Specs/
// scene-format-reference.md): two generated documents, built by the running host from its own
// registrations so they cannot describe a different build.
//   * SceneExample.scene.xml - a real SaveScene of a scene composed in code: every registered
//     component at its defaults on an entity of its own, every settings block, a parent and
//     child, a script behaviour carrying one override of each property kind. Exactly what
//     scene_write accepts, because it is what the engine writes.
//   * SceneSchema.json - what each Serialize body wrote, recorded through the real write path
//     (SchemaRecorder): keys, kinds and defaults in wire order, the data-version chain, joined to
//     reflection for enum names, attributes and reference targets.
// Both are deterministic: seeded guids, composition order, no stamps. The hosts serve them as
// `docs://generated/*` beside the shipping docs, and `component_schema` answers one entry.
