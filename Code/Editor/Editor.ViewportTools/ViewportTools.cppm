// Editor::ViewportTools - the `editor.viewporttools` module.
//
// The viewport TOOL-MODE framework (terrain spec, editing-experience decisions 2026-08-10): a 3D
// viewport hosts exactly one active tool at a time - select+gizmos is the DEFAULT tool, terrain
// sculpting / splat painting / future scatter brushes are modal tools - so the viewport has ONE
// input-routing path instead of a special case plus N imitations.
//
// Deliberately NOT in Editor.Core: the tool contract speaks pick rays, pointer state and overlay
// drawing, and Editor.Core is UI-free (headless hosts link it). This lib is the thin layer above
// it: domain editor libs (Editor.Terrain, ...) implement tools against this interface WITHOUT
// linking the scene page; the scene page hosts the manager and builds the per-frame input.
//
// Input is a PLAIN STRUCT the host fills each frame (the GizmoFrameInput precedent - whole
// gesture sessions are scriptable headlessly in tests). Mutation goes through EditorCommandStack
// commands ONLY (one command/group per gesture) - never direct writes; that is what makes agent
// writes (MCP P2b) and human tools land on the same undo path.
