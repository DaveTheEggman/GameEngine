// Editor::Preview - :thumbnail_stage partition.
//
// The GPU half of asset thumbnails: a persistent hidden preview scene plus an offscreen
// render-and-readback pipeline that turns ThumbnailService's queued scene jobs into 128x128
// pixels. The service owns generators, queueing and publication; this stage owns everything
// GPU: the scene the generators populate, an ortho camera framed from the generator's bounds
// (eye along (1,1,1), half-extent = radius * 1.1 - rotation-invariant framing), a 4x
// supersampled target (512 -> 128 box downscale for free anti-aliasing), and a copy-to-buffer
// readback retired by frame-ring round-trip (the copy rides the frame encoder, so it is
// ordered after the render; when the same frame index comes around again the submission has
// provably retired and the buffer maps without a stall).
//
// One job is in flight at a time (ThumbnailService::TakeSceneJob enforces it); a generator
// whose resources are still resolving returns Pending and is retried each frame under a
// bounded budget. The interface stays lean and PIMPL'd for the same reason PreviewViewport's
// does: heavy page TUs import this module, so engine.render/engine.scene must not leak in.
