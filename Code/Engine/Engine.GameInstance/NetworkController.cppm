// Engine::GameInstance :networkcontroller partition - a running game's networking, extracted off the
// GameInstance god object (networking-extraction.md P1). It OWNS what GameInstance used to BE: the
// endpoint, the INetworkController implementation, the role lifecycle (StartServer/Connect/Stop), the
// net script binding, and the replicated-scene selection. GameInstance now COMPOSES one and forwards;
// it no longer inherits net::INetworkController.
//
// This is a pure ROLE extraction (P1): the wire protocol, the replication model, and the endpoint
// factories are unchanged - the bodies moved here verbatim. Lives in engine.gameinstance (beside its
// owner); it can migrate to engine.net later if the script surface wants NetworkController.of(context).
