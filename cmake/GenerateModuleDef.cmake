# Generate a .def exporting every External FUNCTION symbol of a target's objects,
# INCLUDING C++20 module-attached ones.
#
# Why this exists: CMake's WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS silently drops module-attached
# symbols. MSVC decorates them with a module suffix -
#
#     ?IsLoaded@DynamicLibrary@core@foundation@@QEBA_NXZ::<!foundation.core>
#
# - and CMake's def generator does not emit those names, so a shared Core exported 221
# CRT/STL symbols and none of its own 1994 module functions. link.exe itself accepts the
# decorated names in a .def perfectly well (verified), so this is a CMake gap, not a
# toolchain limit. See Documentation/Specs/shared-libraries.md section 5 (P5).
#
# FUNCTIONS ONLY, deliberately. Exported DATA needs __declspec(dllimport) at the point of
# use to be read correctly through an import table, which the "one BMI for producer and
# consumer" model cannot express. That is not a gap here: the P2 rendezvous work already
# moved every piece of process-wide state behind a non-inline accessor FUNCTION, and the
# sharedlib tripwire keeps it that way.
#
# Invoked at PRE_LINK with:
#   DUMPBIN      - path to dumpbin.exe
#   OBJECTS_FILE - file listing the object paths, one per line (NOT a -D list: a ;-list
#                  argument needs COMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS, which splits it into separate argv
#                  entries and loses every object after the first)
#   DEF_FILE     - output path
