// Mover - moves an entity back and forth and spins it: a saw sliding along its track, a spiky
// ball swinging across a bridge. The motion is a smooth swing (a sine) from where it was placed,
// `distance` either side along `axis`; the spin is about `spinAxis`. With a Hazard on the same
// entity, the hazard hurts wherever the mover has taken it.
