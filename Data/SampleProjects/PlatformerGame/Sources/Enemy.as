// Enemy - a patroller: it walks back and forth along X between two points, facing the way it
// walks. Touching it hurts the player, unless the player comes down on it from the air, which
// defeats it ("EnemyDefeated") and bounces the player off it. On the enemy's entity, whose first
// child is its model.
//
// Touching is a box, not a sphere: within `radius` across the ground and with the player's centre
// no higher than `touchHeight` above the enemy's origin (and not below it). Only a player in the
// air and on the way down stomps; one on the ground, walking or standing into the enemy, is hurt,
// however the enemy's origin sits against the ground the player walks on.
//
// A flier (the bee) is the same enemy in the air: it hovers, bobbing `hoverHeight` up and down,
// and may patrol across the path (along Z) rather than along it. It is stomped and hurts the same
// way, measured from where it flies.
// FX/FxStompStars: the burst where an enemy was stomped.
