// Pickup - something worth taking that is not a coin: a heart (a life) or a gem (a bonus). It
// spins and bobs like a coin, and when the player comes within reach it is taken: the event named
// in `takenEvent` goes out with `value` ("LifeCollected", "GemCollected"), a sparkle and a chime
// mark it, and it is gone. On the pickup's entity, whose first child is its model.

// FX/FxCoinSparkle: the burst where something was taken.
