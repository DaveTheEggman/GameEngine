# Shared libraries - engine as .so/.dll

Status: DESIGN (2026-09-04). Track branch: `shared-libraries`.
Goal: the engine's 179 static library targets can build as shared libraries,
with correct behavior across library boundaries. Motivating uses: real plugin
DLLs (PluginHost exists but only works today because the test plugin touches
no shared state), faster iterative links, and eventually a distributable SDK.

This doc is grounded in two full-tree audits (RTTI identity; globals + build
system). Key file:line references are inlined below.

## 1. The two real problems

Everything reduces to **identity** and **rendezvous**:

- **Identity**: type metadata compared by pointer. Each DLL gets its own copy
  of vague-linkage (inline/template) entities, so `&TypeOf<T>()` in DLL A !=
  `&TypeOf<T>()` in DLL B, and every pointer compare silently fails.
- **Rendezvous**: process-wide state reached through inline accessors with
  function-local statics. Each DLL gets its own instance, so a registry
  written by one library is empty when read from another.

What we do NOT have to solve (verified):

- No static-initializer registration anywhere; all registration is explicit
  composition roots (Pipeline.Registration, Engine.ScriptSurface, per-module
  RegisterTypes). No --whole-archive games needed.
- PIC already on globally (root CMakeLists:28).
- Cross-heap frees largely designed out by the I5 allocator idiom (owner
  carries IAllocator&; DefaultAllocator's SystemAllocator is stateless, so
  even duplicated copies free each other's blocks correctly).
- stb/cgltf/miniaudio implementation TUs are one-per-library already.

## 2. Type identity redesign (the RTTI change)

### Current state

- `TypeInfo` already carries a stable `TypeId` = FNV-1a 64 of `"ns::Name"`
  (TypeInfo.cppm:65 ComputeTypeId; Hash.cppm HashBytes). Reflected object
  types get it via RTTI_DEFINE_OBJECT; enums get it patched in EnumBuilder.
- BUT unreflected value types get `id = address of the function-local
  static` (TypeInfo.cppm:88-99) - explicitly "process-stable", which under
  DLLs becomes module-stable. All primitives (f32, bool, Array<T>, Ref<T>)
  sit in this bucket.
- Casting walks base chains with POINTER compares (Object.cppm:46-74,
  IsDerivedFrom / IsA / Cast - 328 Cast sites).
- `Instance::TryGet<T>` compares `m_type == &TypeOf<T>()`; `Variant::Is<T>`
  compares an inline-variable vtable ADDRESS (kVariantVTable<T>).
- Registries: the safe ones already key on TypeId (SerializableRegistry,
  resource factories, settings sections, content DB). The breaking ones key
  on `const TypeInfo*`: RuntimeContext subsystem locator, Scene
  m_systemsByType + component-manager routing, inspector dispatch (54
  compares), script binding (46 sites), replication (24 sites), builder
  registry.

### Decision: TypeId (the hash) becomes THE identity; pointers stay as a
### fast path within canonical metadata

1. **Compile-time ids for every type.** `TypeOf<T>()` gets its id from a
   `constexpr` hash of the type's name derived from
   `__PRETTY_FUNCTION__`/`__FUNCSIG__` (compiler-stable within one build,
   which is the only requirement - all DLLs in a process come from one
   toolchain). Reflected types keep ComputeTypeId(ns, name); REFLECT_VALUE
   continues to overwrite the id with the authored one (already stable).
   The address-derived id dies. NOTE: ids must stay stable across
   DEBUG/RelWithDebInfo and across compilers only for DISK formats - disk
   already goes through authored names (SerializationTypeId precedent in
   Component.cppm:59), so pretty-function ids are runtime-only identity and
   never serialized. Enforce that with a lint/test.
2. **Comparison by id.** IsDerivedFrom/IsA/Cast compare `t->id == base->id`
   while still walking the `base` chain (chain pointers are internally
   consistent within whichever DLL built the TypeInfo, and ids make the
   compare DLL-safe). Instance::TryGet compares ids. Variant::Is<T>
   compares `m_vtable->typeInfo()->id` (one extra indirection; the vtable
   pointer compare stays as a same-DLL fast path:
   `m_vtable == &kVariantVTable<T> || id compare`).
3. **Canonicalization through GlobalTypeRegistry.** Register() already
   dedups by id and keeps the first TypeInfo* (TypeRegistry.cppm:49). Add
   `Canonical(const TypeInfo&) -> const TypeInfo&` (FindById with fallback
   to the argument). Pointer-keyed registries (RuntimeContext, Scene
   systems map) switch their keys to TypeId - mechanical, and TypeId keys
   are hashable today.
4. **In-place mutation stays, becomes registration-gated.** REFLECT_VALUE /
   EnumBuilder / RegisterArrayType const_cast-patch `TypeOf<T>()`; under
   DLLs each library that calls the registrar patches its own copy. That is
   acceptable ONLY for the library that registers; consumers must resolve
   metadata through the registry (Canonical) rather than trusting their
   local copy's properties. Inspector/serialization already go through
   registry lookups for disk paths; audit the direct `TypeOf<T>().properties`
   reads.
   SUPERSEDED 2026-09-05 (W1 ruling, Section 5): the `TypeInfo` behind
   `TypeOf<T>()` is now PROCESS-SINGLE (`detail::TypeInfoSlot`, Core impl
   unit), so a registrar's patch is what every library reads and
   `&TypeOf<T>()` is one address per process. `Canonical()` stays as the
   belt-and-braces resolver for metadata that arrives as a by-value clone.
5. **PolymorphicElementFactory<Base> static-inline function pointers**
   (Reflection.cppm:866): audited P1 - NOT cross-library load-bearing. The
   readers are the ContainerInfo lambdas instantiated inside the same
   RegisterPolymorphicArrayType<Base> call that writes the pointers, so
   write and read are always co-located in the registering library. The
   actual cross-library gap is a consumer trusting its LOCAL
   TypeOf<Arr>().container (unpatched copy) - covered by the Canonical()
   rule, not by moving the factory.

Blast-radius numbers for planning: 314 TypeOf<> sites, 670 StaticType()
sites, 328 Cast<> sites, 54-compare inspector chain, 46 script-binding
compares, 24 replication compares. Most sites do not change (Cast's
signature is stable; only its internals change); the pointer-keyed MAPS
change (about a dozen).

## 3. Rendezvous fixes (globals)

Exactly-once state moves to the proven SAFE shape: accessor DECLARED in the
.cppm, DEFINED in the library's .cpp impl unit (the pattern GlobalLogger,
DefaultAllocator, GlobalSerializableRegistry already follow). Inventory to
de-inline (each is a one-line-per-site mechanical move):

- P0 (breaks everything): `t_pendingControl` RefCounted handshake
  (RefCounted.cppm:49) - MakeRef in DLL A parks the control block, ctor in
  DLL B must see it. Accessor function in Core's impl unit.
- Registries/singletons: Categories() (RenderData.cppm:141), Font
  Parser/Baker factories + CacheSlot (Fonts/Factories.cppm - was Fonts.IO),
  ScriptBackendRegistry::Get (BackendRegistry.cppm:38),
  ScriptLanguageCookRegistry (ScriptAsset.cppm:569), g_currentContext +
  ScriptCallScope (IScriptContext.cppm:162), g_globalJobs + WorkerSlot
  thread-local (JobSystem.cppm:490,456), Profiler::Get + s_local
  (Profiler.cppm:54,251), ViewId::Create counter (ViewId.cppm:55), UI
  markup/theme/SSS registries incl. the inline `static bool registered`
  guard (MarkupRegistry.cppm:359+, ThemeRegistry.cppm:27,
  UITypeRegistry.cppm:27, SSSParser.cppm:871,915), EditorRootSlot
  (Editor.Core/Context.cppm:35), MemoryTags (MemoryTag.cppm:54),
  ReflectionMutationGenerationRef (Variant.cppm:89 - per-DLL generation
  counters would let stale Variant borrows revalidate = UAF).
- Windows-only visibility work: the SAFE-shape functions (GlobalLogger,
  DefaultAllocator, GlobalTypeRegistry...) need export annotations; on ELF
  with default visibility they already resolve to one copy.

**Tripwire (required, rides P2):** clone the allocator-tripwire pattern - a
Core test that scans module interface units for `inline` + function-local
statics and namespace-scope/static-inline variables holding state, with a
pinned allowlist that also fails on stale entries.

## 4. Build system

- New `util_add_engine_library()` helper in cmake/Helpers.cmake wrapping
  add_library + ALIAS + (later) visibility props/export defines; migrate
  the 179 CMakeLists to it FIRST so every later switch is one edit.
  STATIC/SHARED selected by an `ENGINE_SHARED_LIBS` option (explicit; do
  not rely on BUILD_SHARED_LIBS which today silently no-ops).
- ELF runtime search: BUILD_RPATH/INSTALL_RPATH `$ORIGIN` on executables +
  libraries (today only DXC/wgpu dev rpaths exist). util_copy_runtime_deps
  already generalizes on Windows via TARGET_RUNTIME_DLLS.
- AngelScript double-link (Foundation/Script.AngelScript AND
  Pipeline/Script.AngelScript.Pipeline both PRIVATE-link the static
  archive): under shared libs that is two AngelScript runtimes incl. two
  thread managers. Fix: single wrapper library owns the archive (OBJECT lib
  or make the wrapper the only consumer).
- Jolt/Luau/imgui/etc: single-consumer static links, fine as-is.
  CORRECTION 2026-09-05 (W2): SDL3 was on this list and should not have been -
  Shell.Desktop AND Shell.Desktop.Tests both link it, so a shared build got two
  SDL runtimes with two event queues. It now follows ENGINE_SHARED_LIBS like
  AngelScript. The test for this list is "how many targets link it?", not
  "does it look like a leaf dependency".
- MSVC + modules + dllexport was the highest-uncertainty item (one BMI read
  by producer and consumers; the classic FOO_API export/import macro dance
  does not transfer). RESOLVED 2026-09-04 - see the P5/W1 verdict in
  Section 5: generated `.def` for functions + `ENGINE_EXPORT_DATA` for static
  data, no import macros at all. The CORE_EXPORT / CORE_IMPORT / CORE_API
  placeholders in Prelude.h:120-138 stay unused and can be deleted.

## 5. Phases

- **P1 - stable type identity.** Compile-time ids in TypeOf<T>; id-based
  IsDerivedFrom/IsA/Cast/Instance/Variant; TypeId-keyed RuntimeContext +
  Scene maps; registry Canonical(); PolymorphicElementFactory registry.
  Tests: cross-"module" identity unit tests (two TUs simulating divergent
  copies), full battery green as static build. NO behavior change intended.
- **P2 - rendezvous.** De-inline the Section-3 inventory into impl units;
  new tripwire test with pinned allowlist.
- **P3 - build plumbing.** util_add_engine_library + 179-target migration +
  ENGINE_SHARED_LIBS option + $ORIGIN rpaths + AngelScript single-owner.
  Static build stays byte-equivalent.
- **P4 - first shared build (Linux/clang).** STATUS 2026-09-04: the flip
  WORKED FIRST TRY - build/clang-shared (ENGINE_SHARED_LIBS=ON) builds all
  179 libraries as .so with zero link errors, the full 151-suite battery
  passes ON the shared build, and Tools.Editor boots a real project linked
  against 163 engine .so files. P1-P3 cleared the ground completely (ELF
  default visibility does the rest). REMAINING P4 TAIL: (a) DONE (user
  approved 2026-09-04): the SUPPORTED PLUGIN MODEL is plugins linked against
  the SHARED engine (ENGINE_SHARED_LIBS builds) - static-engine plugins
  would re-embed Core and are explicitly unsupported (the old TestPlugin
  stays as the plugin-local-state regression). Runtime.CrossPlugin (shared
  lanes only) + a RuntimeTests case prove identity + rendezvous across a
  real dlopen boundary: TypeId-keyed host-subsystem resolution, MakeRef'd
  object crossing + host-side Cast/Release, shared GlobalTypeRegistry;
  (b) OUTPUT DIR: DONE (user ruling 2026-09-04) - ENGINE_SHARED_LIBS defaults
  BUILDSYSTEM_OUTPUT_SUFFIX to "-Shared" (the -ASAN precedent), so shared
  builds land in Bin/<cfg>/<plat>-<comp>-Shared; an explicit suffix wins; (c) a CI-able smoke lane.
- **P5 - hidden visibility + Windows.** CXX_VISIBILITY_PRESET hidden +
  VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN (converts residual duplication into link
  errors), export annotations, MSVC prototype verdict applied.

### P5 / W1 verdict - MSVC + C++20 modules + DLL (prototyped 2026-09-04)

Prototype: Foundation::Core built SHARED (Core.dll, 2415 exports) with
Core.Tests as the consumer, build/msvc-shared-proto, MSVC 14.51.36231.
Result: **it works. Windows does NOT have to stay static.** The slice links
with **zero unresolved symbols** and, after the TypeOf-slot ruling below,
**Core.Tests is 286/286 against a shared Core** (28556 assertions) with the
MSVC static build unchanged at 286/286.

As first prototyped (2026-09-04, before the ruling) it was 266 of 284: the 18
`core-reflection` cases were the exception - 16 failed and the first
segfaulted, aborting the process and marking the rest of a normal run
"skipped". That was never an export problem; see "The identity gap" below.

**Which hypothesis holds.** Both 1 and 2 work, and they cover *disjoint*
problems, so the shipped shape is a hybrid. Hypothesis 3 (per-library
`CORE_API` macro dance) is **not needed and should not be built** - see
"Why not per-library macros".

- **H1 - `WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS`: fails as shipped, but is rescuable.**
  CMake's own `bindexplib` skips module-attached symbols, which carry a
  `::<!module.name>` suffix (`?Foo@@YAHXZ::<!foundation.core>`); it exported
  **0** of Core's functions. The symbols are perfectly ordinary `External`
  `notype ()` entries in the objects - only the def *generator* was blind to
  them. Replacing it with `cmake/GenerateModuleDef.cmake` (dumpbin `/symbols`
  -> filter External functions -> emit a `.def`) exports **2390** functions
  with **zero source churn**. This is the workhorse.
- **H2 - `export __declspec(dllexport)` in the module interface: works
  completely, and is the ONLY thing that works for DATA.** MSVC is
  module-aware here: the BMI records the export, and consumers reading that
  same BMI get the *import* side automatically. There is no `dllimport`
  anywhere in `Code/` (the `CORE_IMPORT` placeholder in Prelude.h:127 stays
  unused). Verified runtime-correct for virtuals, out-of-line members, static
  member functions, `thread_local` accessors, function-local statics, and
  static data members.

**The exact incantation.**

1. `cmake/GenerateModuleDef.cmake` + the `ENGINE_SHARED_LIBS` branch of
   `util_add_engine_library`: a PRE_LINK step generates `<name>_exports.def`
   and adds `/DEF:` to the link. Object paths are passed through a
   `file(GENERATE)`d list file - NOT as a command argument, because
   `COMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS` splits `$<TARGET_OBJECTS>` on `;` and the script
   then sees a single object (this silently produced 8 symbols instead of
   2252 during bring-up).
2. `ENGINE_EXPORT_DATA` (Prelude.h) = `__declspec(dllexport)` when
   `BUILDSYSTEM_SHARED_LIBS`, empty otherwise. Applied to **static DATA
   members only** - 7 sites today: Guid, Color, Color32, Float2, Float3,
   Float4, Quaternion. Functions never need it.
3. `BUILDSYSTEM_SHARED_LIBS=1` is defined **globally** on the `policy`
   interface target, not per-target. That is deliberate and load-bearing: one
   BMI is read by the definer *and* every consumer, so the macro must expand
   identically in both. A per-target define would make the definer's BMI
   disagree with the consumer's view of it.

**Why not per-library macros (`FOUNDATION_CORE_API` etc.).** The classic
Windows pattern needs a *different* expansion in the producer (dllexport) and
the consumer (dllimport) of the same header. A module interface is compiled
**once**, into one BMI that both sides read, so that split cannot be
expressed - the macro has already been baked. What makes the single-spelling
approach work is that MSVC records the export *in the BMI* and derives the
import side per consumer. Verified with a deliberate two-library test (a
second DLL consuming the first through two boundaries returned correct
values), so one global macro genuinely serves every library.

**Limits found.**

- **DATA cannot go through the `.def`.** Exporting a data symbol by name in a
  `.def` is not enough: the consumer still emits a *direct* reference rather
  than an `__imp_` indirection, because only a `dllimport` declaration
  changes the use site - and the single BMI cannot carry one. Data must use
  the `ENGINE_EXPORT_DATA` annotation. This is the whole reason both
  hypotheses are needed.
- **STL template statics reachable through a module interface break
  consumers.** `std::to_chars`/`from_chars`' *floating-point* path instantiates
  `std::_General_precision_tables_2<double>` whose static data members hit
  exactly the limit above - every consumer of a shared Core failed to link on
  them. Fix: the three float conversions now route through non-inline
  `detail::FloatToChars` / `FloatFromChars` / `FloatToCharsFixed`, defined in
  `Core/Text/TextImpl.cpp`, so the instantiation stays inside Core and no
  consumer ever references it. Integral `to_chars` has no such tables and
  stays inline. **Generalizes:** any STL facility with template-static state
  used from a module interface needs the same treatment.
- **Scale is a non-issue.** Core: 2252 unique External function symbols (1994
  module-attached), 481 data symbols - 3.4% of the 64K export cap.

**The identity gap (gated W2; RESOLVED 2026-09-05): templates duplicate per
image.** Confirmed by dumpbin on the consumer object:

- `GlobalTypeRegistry` -> `UNDEF` = **imported from Core.dll**. Non-template
  module-attached functions - *including `inline` ones with function-local
  statics* - are emitted once, in the owning module's TU, and consumers import
  them. Rendezvous is therefore safe **by construction** on MSVC, with no
  de-inlining required. This is stronger than ELF, which needs default
  visibility to get the same result.
- `TypeOf<Float3>` -> `SECT25E` = **the consumer emitted its own copy**.
  Templates must instantiate per-TU, so `TypeOf<T>()`'s function-local
  `TypeInfo` is **one instance per image**. `RegisterCoreTypes()` runs inside
  Core.dll and patches *Core's* copy; the executable reads its own unpatched
  copy and sees 0 properties, then dereferences the resulting null
  `PropertyInfo*`. This is not one bad test - it means **every REFLECT_*-patched
  type is invisible across a DLL boundary**, which is why 16 of the 18
  `core-reflection` cases fail (properties, methods, constants, constructors,
  enums, container access, registry-by-name). Everything else in Core - 266
  cases - is unaffected.

Linux never surfaced this because ELF unifies vague-linkage symbols across
`.so` boundaries at load time. PE has no such interposition - Windows behaves
like the hidden-visibility end state P5 is aiming at, so **it detects the gap
that Linux-shared is currently papering over**. Expect the same failures on
Linux the moment `VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN` lands.

Two candidate fixes were on the table - (a) canonicalize the ~20 metadata
readers in Reflection.cppm through `GlobalTypeRegistry().Canonical()`, or
(b) move the slot out of the template - and the Windows session recommended
(b).

**RULING 2026-09-05 (Linux session): (b), applied.** The deciding facts, from
the code rather than the failure count:

- (a) is not localized: 170 raw `TypeInfo*` compares live outside
  Reflection.cppm (replication, scene resource, both script backends, the
  inspector) and every one would need the id-compare sweep.
- (a) does not even find the right instance: `REFLECT_VALUE` patches by
  whole-struct assignment and REWRITES `id` to the authored name hash, so the
  consumer's unpatched copy still carries the signature id and an id-keyed
  `Canonical()` lookup misses it.
- (b)'s "design work" collapses once the semantics are pinned: the table is
  STATIC STORAGE (zero-initialized .bss: usable from the first call in static
  init, nothing to destroy, no allocator on the common path), the lock is a
  constant-initialized `SpinLock` taken once per (image, T) first use (the
  per-image cache is a REFERENCE, so the steady-state cost is the same
  guarded load as before), and hot reload is exactly right because a rebuilt
  module finds its slots already there: `REFLECT_VALUE` / `EnumBuilder`
  re-patch them (last registrar wins) and the slot refreshes only the
  prototype-derived layout facts (`size`/`align`).

Shape (Core/RTTI/TypeInfo.cppm + the new Core/RTTI/TypeInfoImpl.cpp):
`TypeOf<T>()` = `static TypeInfo& info = detail::TypeInfoSlot(SignatureTypeId<T>(),
ValuePrototype<T>()); return info;`. The table = an open-addressing index
(16384 entries, <= 50% load) keyed by SIGNATURE id (stable even after the
authored id is patched in) + a pool of 4096 `TypeInfo` slots, both in .bss;
past those sizes it grows onto the heap (index rehash, further pool chunks),
which is never freed - a slot must outlive its first registrar's image.
Why not the heap from the start: the first cut allocated the table lazily
and ASAN's `Runtime.Tests` reported 472 bytes leaked from `<unknown module>`
- the STATIC-lane test plugin embeds its own Core (the unsupported model,
but a test dlcloses it) and its private table was orphaned on unload; static
storage leaves nothing behind. `TypeInfo.cppm` is on the tripwire allowlist
for the per-image reference; `TypeInfoImpl.cpp` on the allocator allowlist
for the growth path (a composition root).

**Linux now models PE for this symbol.** `TypeOf<T>()` is
`COMPILER_ATTR_HIDDEN` (`visibility("hidden")` on GCC/clang, nothing on
MSVC). Proof it matters: with the attribute alone, the Linux shared lane's
Core.Tests reproduced the Windows failure EXACTLY (`core-reflection:
value-type properties are reflected` - `Properties(vec3).Size() == 0`, null
`PropertyInfo*`, SIGSEGV, 34 passed / 1 crashed); with the slot, 287/287.
The shared-lane cross-boundary test now also has the plugin hand back its own
`&TypeOf<Float3>()` (== the host's) and its property count (3) after the
HOST ran `RegisterCoreTypes()` - the W1 scenario across a real dlopen
boundary, and the plugin's `TypeOf` resolves through Core's single exported
`TypeInfoSlot` (`nm` shows it as the plugin's only reference).

**CONFIRMED ON WINDOWS 2026-09-05.** The prediction held exactly, with no
Windows-side change: pulling the ruling into build/msvc-shared-proto and
rebuilding gives shared Core.Tests **286/286** (28556 assertions, was 266 of
284, and 286 rather than 284 because the ruling adds two `rtti-shared` cases);
MSVC static is **286/286** too, so the slot costs the static lane nothing.
Both `TypeOf<Float3>` reads and the `REFLECT_*` patches now agree across the
Core.dll boundary. **W2 is unblocked.**

Consequences: `Object::StaticType()` needs nothing
(non-template, one definition per owning library, imported by consumers).
The unused `CORE_EXPORT`/`CORE_IMPORT`/`CORE_API` placeholders are deleted;
`COMPILER_ATTR_HIDDEN` took their place in Prelude.h. This was an
**identity** problem, not an export problem: W4's export-annotation pass
remains unnecessary.

### P5 / W2 - the full shared build on Windows (2026-09-05): GREEN

`cmake --preset msvc-shared` (new; mirrors `clang-shared`) + a
`windows-msvc-shared` CI job. **All 182 DLLs build and the full 148-suite
battery passes 100%**, including `Runtime.Tests` - whose "a shared-engine
plugin shares identity + rendezvous with the host" case proves W1's slot
across a real `LoadLibraryW` boundary - and `Script.AngelScript.Tests`, which
exercises the x64 MASM trampoline inside a DLL. The MSVC static lane is
unchanged. Getting there needed three things, and only the first was expected:

**1. Export annotations for static data, demand-driven (8 sites).** The
generated `.def` carries functions; static DATA members still need
`ENGINE_EXPORT_DATA`, exactly as W1 predicted. The linker names them one at a
time, so these were added as they appeared rather than by a speculative sweep:
`ViewId::Invalid`, `Easing`'s 31 function pointers, `ViewTransform::Identity`,
`VGVertex::SizeInBytes` (UI/VG), `CookDb::kDefaultName` (Pipeline.Cook),
`LoopbackLink::kRemotePeer` (Net), `RecentProjectsSettings::kMaxEntries` and
`ThumbnailService::kThumbnailSize` (Editor.Core). Two refinements to the W1
guidance:

- **`const`-integral is NOT exempt.** `kRemotePeer` (`static constexpr PeerId`)
  and `kMaxEntries` (`usize`) still failed: odr-using one - binding it to a
  `const&` parameter, taking its address - needs the definition, which in a
  module interface is emitted only in the owning library's TU.
- **Annotate the MEMBER, not the class, for anything non-trivial.**
  `class ENGINE_EXPORT_DATA CookDb` does not compile: `dllexport` on a class
  forces emission of every implicit member, and CookDb holds move-only
  `UniquePtr` storage, so its deleted copy constructor is referenced (C2280);
  it also flags each non-exported member type C4251, which is an error under
  our warnings-as-errors. Class-level is fine only for trivially copyable
  value types with no non-static members (the Core 7, `Easing`, `ViewId`,
  `ViewTransform`, `VGVertex`).

**2. Third-party runtimes that MORE THAN ONE target links must follow the
engine's library type.** Two cases, same bug, and the second is new:

- AngelScript was already handled (P3), but as a Windows DLL it exported
  nothing, so no import library was produced at all and consumers failed with
  `LNK1104: cannot open angelscript.lib`. It is a classic C++ target, not a
  module, so CMake's own `WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS` works - the
  module-attached-symbol gap that forced our `.def` generator does not apply.
- **SDL3 was NOT handled, and Section 4's "single-consumer static links, fine
  as-is" was wrong about it.** `Foundation::Shell.Desktop` links it, and so
  does `Shell.Desktop.Tests` (directly, so it can push synthetic events). A
  static archive embedded in both a DLL and the exe is **two SDL runtimes with
  two event queues**: the events the test pushed went to its own copy while the
  shell polled the DLL's, so window-close and keyboard cases failed. SDL now
  follows `ENGINE_SHARED_LIBS` like AngelScript. Audit the remaining vendored
  archives against "how many targets link this?" rather than assuming.

**3. Windows is where this class of bug surfaces first - again.** Both the SDL
double-runtime and W1's `TypeOf<T>` slot are the same underlying story: ELF
interposition unifies duplicated symbols across `.so` boundaries and hides the
duplication; PE has no interposition, so the duplicates stay real. The Linux
shared lane passes these tests today for a reason that is not correctness.

Also confirmed on the W2 checklist: import libraries land in
`Bin/<cfg>/<plat>-MSVC-Shared/lib/`, executables and their engine DLLs share
the output directory so the loader finds them with no PATH setup,
`VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN` is a harmless no-op on MSVC, and the largest
generated `.def` (Editor.Scene) is 11918 functions - still a fraction of the
64K export cap.

### P5 / W3 - game native code on Windows (2026-09-05): GREEN

The dev loop works end to end; details and the vcvars ruling live in
game-native-code.md N5. Two findings belong here because they generalize
beyond game modules:

- **`ENGINE_EXPORT_DATA` must key on the COMPILER, and `COMPILER_MSVC` is
  right.** This was briefly "corrected" to `PLATFORM_WINDOWS` on the theory
  that PE needs exports regardless of compiler; the full-tree clang build
  disproved it (12 targets failing). The two compilers need OPPOSITE things:

  - `cl` emits a module-attached inline variable ONLY in its owning module's
    TU - the same one-definition behaviour that makes `GlobalTypeRegistry`
    show up `UNDEF` in consumers (W1). A consumer therefore REFERENCES Core's
    copy, and the export is what makes that resolve.
  - `clang` emits its own COMDAT copy in every TU that uses the variable, so a
    consumer needs no export at all - and it takes the `dllexport` literally in
    each of those TUs, planting `/EXPORT:<sym>,DATA` in the CONSUMER's object.
    The consumer then asks the linker to export a symbol only Core.dll defines:
    `lld-link: error: <root>: undefined symbol: ...Float3::Zero`. Verified with
    `dumpbin -directives` on Animation's objects.

  Everything the macro is applied to is an inline CONSTANT, so clang's
  per-image copies are value-identical and harmless - the W1 identity rule is
  about mutable patched metadata, not constants. **Corollary: MSVC's
  "the BMI carries the export and consumers get the import side" behaviour,
  which the whole W1 verdict rests on, is an MSVC property and NOT a clang
  one.** Anything keyed on `COMPILER_MSVC` deserves this same question, but
  the answer is not automatically "widen it".
- **The generated-`.def` path was gated on `MSVC`, and that skipped the
  `clang` preset entirely.** There are THREE Windows configurations, not two:

  | driver | CMake `MSVC` | `COMPILER_MSVC` | preset |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `cl.exe` | true | 1 | `msvc`, `msvc-shared` |
  | `clang-cl.exe` | true | 0 | none |
  | `clang++.exe` (GNU driver, MSVC ABI, lld-link) | **false** | 0 | `clang`, `clang-reldbg` |

  CMake sets `MSVC` from the compiler FRONTEND, so it is false for the `clang`
  preset even though the output is PE and the ABI is MSVC's. Measured before
  the fix: `Core.dll` exported **92 of 2416** functions - only the explicitly
  `dllexport`'d ones - and every consumer would have failed to link. Both the
  dumpbin lookup and the `.def` step are now gated on `WIN32`, and the flag is
  passed as `LINKER:/DEF:` rather than a bare `/DEF:` (clang++ in GNU mode
  reads a leading-slash token as a filename and would swallow it silently).
  After: **2405** exports under clang++ vs 2416 under cl - the delta is just
  differing inline decisions - and `lld-link` accepts the module-decorated
  names. A missing dumpbin is now a configure-time FATAL_ERROR naming
  `-DUTIL_DUMPBIN=`, instead of failing identically in the PRE_LINK step of
  all 179 libraries.

**Full-tree clang shared build on Windows: GREEN.** `clang++` at the MSVC ABI
with lld-link, `ENGINE_SHARED_LIBS=ON`: **6196/6196 targets build and the
148-suite battery passes 100%**. The MSVC shared lane is unchanged at 148/148,
so the two Windows compilers now both work shared, from one source, with the
`.def` mechanism shared and the data-export annotation deliberately
MSVC-only.

Still NOT verified: clang-cl (no preset exists for it), and there is no
Windows-clang CI lane - so the guard against regressing this is a person
remembering. Note also that this whole session's builds ran with a stale
`VULKAN_SDK` pointing at an uninstalled SDK, so `Foundation::RHI.Vulkan` and
the three cross-backend pixel-probe suites it gates (Render.Backend.Tests,
VG.Backend.Tests, Engine.Terrain.Backend.Tests) were configured OUT. Every
"148/148" here is 148 of the configured suites, not the full battery.

P1 and P2 are pure wins even if shared builds never ship (they fix the
plugin path that exists today and remove latent UAF/identity traps), so
they land first and independently.

## 6. Rules established for this track

- New identity rule: runtime type identity = TypeId; TypeInfo* compares are
  allowed only as same-DLL fast paths paired with an id compare.
- Pretty-function-derived ids are RUNTIME identity only - never serialized;
  disk formats keep authored names/SerializationTypeId.
- Process-wide state lives behind non-inline accessors defined in impl
  units; the tripwire enforces it.
- A template's function-local static is ONE INSTANCE PER IMAGE on PE (and
  on ELF once hidden). It may cache a REFERENCE to impl-unit-owned state
  (`TypeOf<T>()` -> `detail::TypeInfoSlot`); it may never BE the state.
- Templates whose per-image duplication is by design carry
  `COMPILER_ATTR_HIDDEN`, so the Linux shared lane proves the rendezvous
  the way PE does instead of letting ELF interposition paper over it.

## 7. Future: game native code (researched 2026-09-04, not scheduled)

Traktor (checkout audited in full) is the precedent, and its answers converge
with this track's choices - adopt the shape, modernize the mechanisms.

### What Traktor does (verified, file:line in the audit)
- NO engine-vs-game distinction: every module (engine subsystem or
  MyGame.Shared) builds BOTH ways - shared lib in dev configs, static lib in
  ship configs; one define (T_STATIC) flips export macros AND compiles out
  the dlopen call sites. Game code is "a plugin" only because everything is.
- Dev loop: dlopen(RTLD_GLOBAL) a module-name list from settings; the game's
  module enters the list via a data-driven Feature object attached to the
  target config. No per-plugin entrypoint symbol: loaded modules are
  discovered by scanning the type registry for IRuntimePlugin / IPipeline /
  editor-factory subclasses (their registry scan = our EnumerateDerived).
- Identity: pointer-based, made safe by OUR rendezvous rule (registry =
  file-static array in Core, out-of-line EXPORTED TypeInfo ctor) - plus an
  init_seg hack, a 16384 cap, and a duplicate assert that silently corrupts
  in release. Our TypeId identity is strictly stronger.
- SHIP LINK (the Traktor pattern proper): the editor's Deploy action feeds
  an env-var contract to a Lua script that invokes link.exe/clang++ RAW.
  main() is never generated: Traktor.Runtime.App builds TWICE - executable
  in shared configs, static LIBRARY carrying main() in ship configs - and
  the deploy link is launcher.lib + engine .libs + game .lib -> branded exe.
  Static registration survives archive pruning via hand-listed
  T_FORCE_LINK_REF chains in per-module Module.cpp + /INCLUDE:__module__X.
  Gaps: Linux/macOS deploys cannot static-link at all; the Lua/env-var link
  driver is untyped and 5x duplicated ("link in reverse order" scar).
- SDK: prebuilt engine binaries under bin/latest/<plat>/<config> + engine
  source include path; games never build the engine.

### Raptor plan (adopt / modernize / skip)
- ADOPT one-artifact-kind: game native code = a module through
  util_add_engine_library, same as every engine library (already true).
- ADOPT dev = shared editor dlopens the game module (ruled model; proven by
  Runtime.CrossPlugin). ADOPT the launcher-as-library trick: build the
  player main() as a static lib in ship configs; the exporter links
  launcher + engine + game into the branded executable.
- ADOPT Feature-style data-driven module lists + headless deploy parity
  (same action classes for editor buttons and CI).
- MODERNIZE the link driver: the exporter GENERATES A SMALL CMAKE PROJECT
  and runs cmake --build (correct link order, toolchain location,
  cross-compilation, incremental relink) - never a raw linker invocation.
- MODERNIZE registration: we need NO Module.cpp/T_FORCE_LINK_REF/INCLUDE
  chains - registration is already explicit function calls, so the ship
  build's generated main simply CALLS the game's registration function
  directly. (If self-registering statics are ever wanted, use
  $<LINK_LIBRARY:WHOLE_ARCHIVE> or OBJECT libraries, not forced refs.)
- SKIP their RTLD_GLOBAL requirement: our plugins share state through the
  shared engine's exported accessors (proven under RTLD_LOCAL).
- SDK/BMI: BMIs are compiler/flag-specific and cannot ship like Traktor's
  .libs. v1 = exporter drives a cmake build against the engine checkout
  (prebuilt libs + module interface SOURCES; local BMI compile, cached).
  install(FILE_SET CXX_MODULES) is the eventual packaged-SDK path once
  CMake's support matures.
