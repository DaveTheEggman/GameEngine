# Allocator plumbing - retiring the ambient DefaultAllocator()

> Issue I5's architectural track, started 2026-09-02 (user go). ~3,700
> `DefaultAllocator()` call sites move to EXPLICIT allocators threaded from
> owners. Ground rules from the I5 triage entry + the user's directive:
> **`IAllocator&` parameters are REQUIRED, NEVER DEFAULTED** - a defaulted
> fallback just relocates the ambient-allocator problem one level up, and a
> missing decision must fail at compile time, loudly. Each phase is a
> compile-breaking sweep: the signature changes and EVERY call site in that
> phase updates in the same commit, passing a real allocator decision down
> from its owner. No compatibility shims, no transitional defaults.

## The model

One OWNERSHIP TREE of allocators, rooted at the process:

1. **Root**: the executable's `main` creates the root allocator (the
   `SystemAllocator`, optionally wrapped in tracking for tools/tests) and
   hands it to `foundation.runtime::Context` - whose defaulted ctor param is
   removed in the Core phase. `Context::Allocator()` is the runtime's
   allocator authority.
2. **Systems/subsystems**: take `IAllocator&` at construction (required) and
   typically wrap it in a **`TaggedAllocator`** (`{parent,
   RegisterMemoryTag("Navigation")}`) - one tag per system, from Core's
   existing open MemoryTag registry. `MemoryTagReport()` is the I4 memory
   report's data source ("who owns what" becomes a report, not a hunt).
3. **RefCounted objects**: `MakeRef(allocator, ...)` already records the
   allocator in the control block. Phase 0 adds
   `RefCounted::MemoryAllocator()`, which unlocks the INHERITANCE IDIOM:
   code inside a ref-counted object allocates children from ITS OWN
   allocator (`MakeRef<Label>(MemoryAllocator())`), so whoever created the
   root of a tree decided for the whole tree. This is how the ~2,000 UI
   view-construction sites convert without threading a parameter through
   every control body.
4. **Containers as members of long-lived stores**: constructed with the
   owner's allocator in the init list (`m_items(m_alloc)`).

## Deliberate bounds (what does NOT convert)

- **Plain value structs** (components, math, wire structs) keep
  default-constructed containers. Components live in manager pools; their
  spill allocations attribute to the manager's tag when the manager phase
  lands - per-field threading through POD-ish value types is churn without
  ownership meaning.
- **Hot per-frame paths that never allocate steady-state** (rings, pools,
  scratch buffers) thread the allocator at CONSTRUCTION only (I5 rule).
- **Local/transient containers** in free functions with no owning system
  stay on the default until their module's phase decides an owner. The end
  state for `DefaultAllocator()` is: referenced ONLY at true composition
  roots (executable mains, test mains) and inside the value-struct bound
  above.
- **Tests** construct their own root (tracking) allocator in TestMain and
  pass it explicitly - which also turns every suite into a leak check.
- **Fixed function-pointer ABIs measured during P2** stay unthreaded until
  their owning phase (or permanently, if the owner never materializes):
  the reflection container thunks (`createElement` and friends - shape is
  `(Instance&, usize, TypeInfo&)` across the whole reflected ecosystem),
  the `SerializableFactory` create-by-name path (deserialized object graphs
  - the ContentDatabase seam can add an allocator overload in P3 if
  worthwhile), and the `SerializerFactory` lambda the content DB stores.
  `Thread`'s closure box is a construction-time transient of a value-shaped
  primitive - same family as `Function`'s defaulted parameter (the value
  bound).

## Phase plan (Core-up, the code-standard-cleanup discipline)

Every phase: behavior-identical, both compilers, full battery, ASAN suite
green, and the tag report grows a row per converted system. One module (or
tight cluster) per commit.

- **P0 - enablers** (this session): `RefCounted::MemoryAllocator()`; extend
  Core's existing `:memory_tag` seam (`TaggedAllocator` + MemoryTag registry
  were already in place) with peak bytes, total allocations, and
  `MemoryTagReport()` rows; Context keeps its allocator but gains no
  default-removal yet (that lands with its phase's sweep); tests.
- **P1 - exemplar** (this session): foundation.navigation +
  engine.navigation converted end to end (mesh/query/crowd ctors take
  `IAllocator&`; the scene system owns a tagged "navigation" allocator).
  Small (5 sites) but exercises every idiom; the template for all later
  phases.
- **P2 - Foundation/Core consumers** (DONE): `Context` ctor default REMOVED
  (the first compile-breaking sweep - hosts, runners, editor embed, ~40 test
  sites all made explicit); `ApplicationHost` takes the entry point's
  allocator and threads it into its Context; `JobSystem` takes a required
  allocator backing its worker deques AND every job closure box (leak-checked
  per pool in tests); `RingLogSink` default removed; `Array::Allocator()`
  accessor added (owners thread "allocate like my container" decisions - the
  tiled nav bake's scoped pool now shares its output blob's allocator).
  Registries/reflection builders measured and BOUNDED instead (see the
  deliberate bounds above).
- **P3 - Foundation services**: Xml, Settings, Content, VFS, Http, Net*,
  Audio, Fonts*, Image/Texture/Geometry resource stacks. Each service
  object takes `IAllocator&`; owners thread from Context or their own
  owner. Lands as sub-sweeps: **P3a data backbone part 1 DONE** (XML DOM -
  every node stores its creating allocator, the document's decision covers
  the whole tree, detached subtrees keep their creator's; XmlSerializer
  write mode takes the allocator backing its document; Settings store;
  HttpServer + McpHttpHost). **P3a part 2 DONE**: the ContentDatabase /
  ResourceManager / NativeFileSystem trio - required allocators back
  group/instance nodes, resource handles + pending async loads, and file
  streams/change sources; ~150 construction sites made explicit
  (overwhelmingly test roots). **P3b fonts DONE**: parse/bake APIs take the caller's
  `IAllocator&` (the returned font/atlas/BakedFontData is freed through the
  same allocator - `CachedFont`/`BakedFontData` record it); FontManager /
  TrueTypeFontService / ResourceFontService / FontFactory take required
  allocators; `ExpandR8ToRGBA8` allocates from a passed allocator. The
  global parser/baker slots (TrueTypeFonts / DistanceFieldFonts / factory Shutdown)
  stay process-root pairs by design. **P3c audio DONE**: AudioEngine takes a required
  allocator; its Impl threads it through every voice/bus/effect-node/scene-
  group/reverb allocation, miniaudio VFS bridge files record theirs, and the
  three audio resource factories follow the required-allocator factory
  pattern (DefaultApp creates them from the runtime Context's allocator).
  **P3d net DONE**: HostServer / JoinServer /
  StartNetworking take the caller's allocator (sockets + managers ride it);
  WebSocketServerGateway / ClientSocket / HybridSocket take required
  allocators (per-client handshake parsers from the gateway's);
  SimDatagramNetwork backs its simulated sockets from a required allocator.
  **P3e script backends DONE**: the backend
  registry's create hook takes `IAllocator&`
  (`CreateScriptManagerForLanguage/ForFile` thread the caller's); both
  backends' entry factories take it and every context/object/blob/delegate
  INHERITS the manager tree's allocator via `MemoryAllocator()` - the first
  large-scale use of the inheritance idiom; `ScriptRunHost` roots its run's
  tree with a required allocator; the AS BoxedVariant thunk boxes are a
  documented process-scope bound (captureless engine callbacks).
  **P3f resource factories DONE**: StaticMesh/
  SkinnedMesh/Skeleton/AnimationClip/AnimationGraph/ScriptClass/Terrain/
  SplatWeights/Heightfield/Texture factories take required allocators;
  DefaultApp creates them all from the runtime Context's allocator; the
  cooked-record Build helpers (Heightfield::Build, SplatWeightsSource::
  Build, MigrateLegacySplatmap) allocate their products from a passed
  allocator. **P3g mop-up DONE**: SDL3 shell (CreateShell +
  window/gamepad/dialog managers thread the entry point's allocator; dialog
  contexts record theirs for the SDL C callback), PhysicsWorld (Jolt system/
  temp-allocator/job boxes), ShaderSystemHost + FileShaderSourceProvider,
  Primitives::* take the caller's allocator, Scene.Resource prefab records/
  snapshots/serializer scratch ride scene.Allocator(). Particles' asset-
  definition types and the sniffing-reader scratch stay under the
  reflection/serializer bounds.
- **P4 - UI cluster** (CORE DONE): the pending-control handoff in MakeRef
  makes `MemoryAllocator()` valid INSIDE constructors (thread-local park:
  the RefCounted base ctor adopts the control before the derived body runs
  - covered by a nested-ctor leak test), so control bodies AND ctors switch
  `DefaultAllocator()` -> `MemoryAllocator()` wholesale. `UIContext` takes
  the host's allocator (its managers thread it); `UIHost` roots the whole
  UI; static factories (themes, Palette, SVG drawables, Dialog, markup
  view/params factories, StyleSheetLoader/SSSParser) take the caller's
  allocator - the markup factory ABI is now
  `RefPtr<View>(*)(IAllocator&)`. The ThemeIconSet glyph cache stays a
  documented process-global. Toolkit + Gamekit + Runtime + Viewport rode
  the same sweep; stack-constructed RefCounted views in tests moved to
  MakeRef (the assert catches them loudly). Editor pages/hosts currently
  pass process roots - P6 re-decides those.
- **P5 - Engine subsystems** (DONE): Scene's ctor default REMOVED -
  `Scene(IAllocator&, name)` and `SceneManager(IAllocator&)` make the
  per-scene authority explicit (~200 construction sites); RenderSubsystem
  owns a tagged "Render" allocator threading through every render system,
  pass, cache, RenderFrame, RenderGraph (required allocator; passes/
  resources/pool/profiler ride it), extraction arenas/pools/snapshots, and
  the game-UI UISubsystem owns a tagged "GameUI" allocator (context, roots,
  VG renderers, shader host); ParticleEffectComponentManager scratch rides
  scene.Allocator() (component-struct spill stays value-bound);
  VGRenderer/UIWindowData/animation-graph build helpers take required
  allocators; WebGPU CreateBackend default removed (async map-callback box
  documented as a process-scope pair); the profiler's per-thread slots stay
  a process-global (compile-gated singleton).
- **P6 - Pipeline + Editor + Samples** (DONE): the editor's ~1,450 sites and
  the samples' ~500 converted - view code rides the UI inheritance idiom
  (`MemoryAllocator()`, adapter classes via `m_owner->`, job/dialog lambdas
  via a captured `self->`), non-view service paths (project open/create,
  export/cook workers, thumbnails, MCP tools, log buffers, layout persist)
  made EXPLICIT composition-root decisions; `EditorProject`,
  `EditorJobService`, `EditorLogBuffer` take required allocators.
- **P6b - the editor root** (DONE): `EditorApplication` owns
  `TaggedAllocator{"Editor"}`; `EditorContext` and `EditorPage` carry it
  (required ctor params; pages get `Allocator()`), the editor `UIHost` and
  services construct from it - the editor's whole UI tree and page
  allocations attribute to the Editor tag. ~570 page/app sites became
  owner decisions (SceneEditContext commands ride `m_scene->Allocator()`;
  ProjectManagerView takes the root). Also fixed a latent P6 bug: two
  pre-UIHost sites dereferenced the null host for its allocator.
- **P7 - the lockdown** (DONE): `Core.Tests/AllocatorTripwireTests.cpp`
  scans the source tree each run against the pinned
  `allocator-allowlist.txt` (194 files: composition roots + documented
  bounds). A NEW non-test reference outside the list fails the suite with
  a thread-an-owner message; a cleaned file left on the list fails as
  STALE so the list only shrinks honestly.

## Sweep protocol (every phase)

1. Change the signatures (required `IAllocator&`, stored as `IAllocator*`
   member or wrapped in a member `TaggedAllocator`).
2. Fix every caller IN THE SAME COMMIT with a real decision (owner's
   allocator, never a re-introduced default).
3. Long-lived member containers pick up the owner's allocator in init
   lists.
4. Both compilers + battery + the ASAN suite; `MemoryTagReport()` must show
   the new tag with plausible numbers.

## Report seam (feeds I4 + the memory-profiling seed)

`MemoryTagReport(Array<MemoryTagReportRow>&)` - rows of
{tag, name, liveBytes, peakBytes, liveAllocations, totalAllocations}. The editor
diagnostics panel / MCP report consume this; the memory-profiling weekly
seed's "tagged allocators" piece is THIS, delivered incrementally as phases
land.
