## Goal

An agent (or a person) authoring a scene, prefab or settings block by hand has an exact,
current reference for the text format: a complete worked example scene and a schema of every
component and settings block. Both are produced FROM THE CODE, so they cannot drift from what
the reader accepts:
- a build writes them beside its executables, so a given build carries its own exact format;
- the MCP hosts serve them;
- a checked-in copy plus a golden test turns every wire change into a readable diff in review.

Not goals:
- Changing the scene wire format. Enums stay numeric on the wire; the schema names them.
- A structured authoring API (`entity_create`, `component_add`, ...). That is a separate
  proposal and would consume this schema, not replace it.
- Hand-written format prose. `Scenes.md` keeps the concepts and points at the generated files.

## The problem: reflection is not the wire format

`type_info` looks like the obvious source and is not one. The scene wire format is written by
hand-coded `Serialize` functions; reflection is a separate, parallel description. The two differ
in field set, field order and encoding, and reflection carries no defaults.

- **The component contract** (`Code/Foundation/Scene/Component.cppm:244-309`,
  `SerializableComponentManager<T>`):
  - The wire name is a constructor argument (:248).
  - The payload is an ADL `Serialize(ISerializer&, T&)` wrapped in
    `BeginVersionedPayload(ar, TypeOf<T>())` (:256-277).
- **Encoding differs.** `RigidBodyComponent`'s `Serialize`
  (`Code/Engine/Engine.Physics/PhysicsComponents.cppm:93-119`) writes `motion`, `layer` and
  `shape` as raw `u8` casts. Its reflection (`Code/Engine/Engine.Physics/PhysicsSubsystemImpl.cpp:227-260`)
  declares them as enum-typed properties.
- **Order differs.** The same reflection lists `isTrigger, continuousCollision, mass,
  collisionGroup, collisionShape, material`, while the wire order is `isTrigger,
  collisionGroup, collisionShape, material, heightfield, continuousCollision, mass`. Order
  matters: the XML reader searches FORWARD from a cursor by key
  (`Code/Foundation/Xml.Serialization/XmlSerializer.cppm:325-369`), so fields must follow the
  `Serialize` order, and a missing field fails the read.
- **The field set differs.** `PhysicsSceneSettings` serializes `groupNames` and
  `groupCollides` (`PhysicsComponents.cppm:300-313`), but its reflection omits them
  (`PhysicsSubsystemImpl.cpp:335-341`). `ScriptComponent` reflects no properties at all
  (`Code/Engine/Engine.Script/ScriptSubsystemImpl.cpp:49-54`), while its payload carries
  behaviours and overrides (`Code/Engine/Engine.Script/ScriptComponents.cppm:30-130`).
- **No defaults.** `PropertyInfo` (`Code/Foundation/Core/Reflection/Reflection.cppm:243-259`)
  has name, type, flags, accessors, address and attributes, and no default value. The only
  source of a default is a default-constructed `T{}`.
- **The data version chain is unguessable, and unforgiving.** Each record carries
  `dataVersions`: `{u64 type, u32 version}` for the concrete type and every versioned base
  (`Code/Foundation/Core/Serialization/Serialize.cppm:266-300`). The type id is FNV-1a over
  `namespace + "::" + name` (`Code/Foundation/Core/RTTI/TypeInfo.cppm:70-76`). Any mismatch in
  count, id or version fails the payload (`Serialize.cppm:301-316`), and with it the WHOLE
  `LoadScene` (`Code/Foundation/Scene.Resource/SceneResourceImpl.cpp:2046-2050`).
  `type_info` does not expose `dataVersion`.
- **The registry cannot enumerate what is needed.**
  - Enums and most scene components are not in the registry: `EnumBuilder::Build` only
    patches `TypeOf<E>` (`EnumReflection.cppm:62-73`), and physics component registration
    never calls `Register` (`PhysicsSubsystemImpl.cpp:411-427`).
  - There is no per-domain listing (`Code/Foundation/Core/RTTI/TypeRegistry.cppm:187-316`).
  - What does enumerate the components is a composed scene: `engine::AddAllSceneManagers`
    (`Code/Engine/Engine.SceneSurface/SceneSurfaceImpl.cpp:92-100`) then
    `Scene::ForEachManager` / `ForEachSystem` (`Code/Foundation/Scene/Scene.cppm:327,340`).
- **References are opaque.** `EntityRef` (`Code/Foundation/Scene/Entity.cppm:58-78`) and
  `resource::Ref<T>` (`Code/Foundation/Resource/ResourceModule.cppm:126-208`) both serialize as
  a bare guid string. Neither is `REFLECT_VALUE`'d, so `type_info` shows `"<value>"`.
  - Code recognises `EntityRef` by pointer identity (`SceneResourceImpl.cpp:856-880`).
  - The inspector hard-codes `Ref<T>` per asset type (`Code/Editor/Editor.Scene/InspectorViewImpl.cpp:708-718`).
  - Nothing generic says "this field is a resource reference to asset type X".
- **The script override hash is a second unguessable.** Overrides are keyed by
  `ScriptPropertyNameHash(name)`, FNV-1a 64 over the UTF-8 name
  (`Code/Foundation/Script.Resource/ScriptResource.cppm:52-55`, `Code/Foundation/Core/Hash.cppm:22-33`).
  A `kind` code (`ScriptPropertyType`, `ScriptResource.cppm:38-49`) selects which single
  payload key follows (`ScriptResource.cppm:123-154`).

## What exists (checked, cited per the Specs rule)

- **Scene stream writer and reader** (`Code/Foundation/Scene.Resource/SceneResource.cppm`):
  - `SaveScene` :1353-1377 always writes XML text; `LoadScene` :1347;
    `TranscodeSceneStreamToBinary` :1344.
  - Header magic `0xD5C35CEE` and version 3 at :57-58.
  - Section order: header, name, entities (flat records), components, systemSettings,
    prefabMode, prefabInstances (`SceneResourceImpl.cpp:76-569`).
- **The settings seam**: `SceneSystem::SettingsType / SettingsInstance / SettingsId /
  SerializeSettings` (`Code/Foundation/Scene/SceneSystem.cppm:61-74`).
  - Five blocks exist: `physics`, `environment`, `postprocess`, `sceneScript`, `navigation`
    (declared at `Engine.Physics/PhysicsSubsystem.cppm:99`, `Engine.Render/RenderComponents.cppm:541,661`,
    `Engine.Script/ScriptSubsystem.cppm:1317`, `Engine.Navigation/NavigationSubsystem.cppm:45`).
  - Text records are `{system, dataVersions, settings}` (`SceneResourceImpl.cpp:415-426`).
- **The serializer interface is a plain virtual surface**
  (`Code/Foundation/Core/Serialization/ISerializer.cppm:62-128`): `Mode`, the version scope,
  `Key`, `BeginObject/EndObject`, `BeginArray/EndArray`, `Scalar(void*, ScalarKind)`, `Text`,
  `Blob`, `GuidValue`, `FailPayload`. A new backend is a subclass; nothing in the scene code
  assumes a concrete one.
- **Reflection metadata worth joining in**:
  - Enum value names: `EnumValueName` / `Enumerators` (`EnumReflection.cppm:86-127`).
  - Attributes: `displayName`, `category`, `description`, `range`, `visibleWhen`
    (`Reflection.cppm:512-556`, `TypeBuilder::PropAttribute` :1752).
  - `dataVersion` / `minReadDataVersion` on `TypeInfo` (`TypeInfo.cppm:62,66`).
- **The docs:// channel**:
  - `RegisterShippingDocResources` (`Code/Editor/Editor.Mcp/ProjectTools.cppm:472-510`) serves
    every `*.md` in the located directory, re-read on each request.
  - `LocateShippingDocs` (:553-589) walks up from the executable, then the working directory.
- **Build-time precedent**: samples run an engine-built tool at build time by path
  (`Code/Samples/WebScene/CMakeLists.txt:52-58`, `BUILDSYSTEM_HOST_BIN_DIR` in the root
  `CMakeLists.txt:166,189`).
- **Golden precedent**: none. Tests that read the source tree get `RAPTOR_SOURCE_DIR`
  (`Code/Editor/Editor.Core.Tests/CMakeLists.txt:23`), which is the hook a golden test needs.
- **Reflection registration must precede writing.** Until `RegisterAllSceneComponentReflection()`
  runs, `TypeOf<T>().id` is the compiler-signature id, not the disk id
  (`TypeInfo.cppm:96-111`). `Code/Tools/Tools.Mcp/Main.cpp:80` calls it for exactly that reason.

## Decisions

### D1. The `Serialize` bodies are the source of truth, captured by a recording serializer

A new `ISerializer` backend in WRITE mode, `SchemaRecorder`, is driven through the real write
path over default-constructed instances. It records a tree of what the body did:
- each `Key` with the `ScalarKind` and default value that followed it;
- the nesting of `BeginObject` / `BeginArray`;
- `Text` and `GuidValue` fields.

A component is recorded by adding it with `AddDefaultComponent`
(`Component.cppm:38-73`) to an entity in a composed scratch scene and calling the manager's
`WriteComponent`. A settings block is recorded through `SerializeSettings`.

Because this is the code that writes real scenes, the recorded order, keys, kinds and defaults
ARE the wire format. Reflection never decides structure; it only annotates (D3). The recorder
also captures the `dataVersions` chain as written, so the schema's type ids and versions are
the ones the reader will check.

### D2. Two generated files

**`SceneExample.scene.xml`** is a real `SaveScene` of a scene built in code:
- every registered component on some entity, at its defaults;
- every settings block;
- a parent and child pair;
- a script behaviour carrying one override of each `ScriptPropertyType` kind;
- one prefab instance, if the composition allows it.

It is exactly what `scene_write` accepts, because it is what the engine writes.

**`SceneSchema.json`** is the recorder's trees plus annotations:
- a header section: magic, stream version, section order, prefab mode values;
- per component and per settings block:
  - `wireName`, with the `system` id for settings;
  - `dataVersions`: the chain with ids in decimal and hex, plus the type names they hash from;
  - `fields` in wire order, each with:
    - `key`;
    - `kind` (`u8` / `f32` / `string` / `guid` / `object` / `array` ...);
    - `default`;
    - nested `fields` for objects and array elements;
    - the annotations from D3.
- a `scriptOverrides` section: the hash algorithm with a worked example (a named field's hash
  in decimal), the kind table, and which payload key each kind uses.

JSON is the MCP's interchange format and never engine data, so a JSON schema file is within the
no-JSON-for-engine-data policy (`mcp-agent-access.md`).

### D3. Reflection annotates by joining on the key

Each recorded field is joined to the component's reflected property of the same name when one
exists. It then gains:
- `enum`: the value names, when the reflected type is an enum and the wire kind is an
  integer. This is what makes `motion = 2` readable.
- `displayName`, `description`, `range`, `category`, `visibleWhen`.
- `ref`: `entity` when the reflected type is `TypeOf<EntityRef>()`, including array elements
  through the container element type.

A field with no reflected twin is emitted unannotated and counted in a `unreflected` list per
type. That list is a useful finding in its own right; `groupNames` would show up there today.

### D4. A resource reference's target is joined through the factories and the builders [RULED]

The chain from a `Ref<T>` field to the asset type an agent authors is declared in the code
except for one link, and the ruling (2026-09-27) declares that link on the runtime factory:

- `Ref<T>` names its runtime type T through the reference shape that landed after this spec
  was first written (`ReferenceTraits` / `ReferenceOps` on `TypeInfo::reference`, Core). The
  ops table gains a `Target()` returning T's `TypeInfo`, filled by the `Ref<T>` specialisation:
  capability flowing into reflection at registration, no per-component edit.
- The resource manager keys its factories by that same T (`IResourceFactory::ProductType()`,
  `ResourceModule.cppm`). So the factory for T is found by identity.
- **The missing link, now declared:** `IResourceFactory` gains `CookedType()`, the serialised
  cooked form the factory reads in its Create (`StaticMeshSource` for `StaticMesh`,
  `TextureResource` for `Texture`, `HeightfieldSource` for `Heightfield`). Runtime side, no
  pipeline knowledge, and a statement of what each factory already does. A tripwire test
  checks every factory's cooked type is some builder's product.
- The pipeline's `BuilderRegistry` (`Pipeline.Core/Asset.cppm`) enumerates builders, each
  declaring `AssetType()` and `ProductType()` - the product being that cooked form (the
  heightfield builder documents the deliberate difference from the runtime type). The join
  `factory.CookedType() == builder.ProductType()` yields `builder.AssetType()`.

The schema then emits, for a reference field, `ref: {resource: "StaticMesh", asset:
"StaticMeshAsset"}`; a T with no factory or no builder in the running composition emits the
resource name alone and is counted under `unreflected`. The inspector's hard-coded rows per
asset type (`InspectorViewImpl.cpp`) can later read the same join and go.

### D5. Determinism is part of the contract

The generator must produce byte-identical output for the same code:
- entity and asset guids from a seeded `Random` (`Guid::Generate(rng)`);
- components and settings in composition order (`kAllModules`, `SceneSurfaceImpl.cpp:41-80`),
  then plugin contributions in registration order;
- the existing XML float formatting;
- no timestamps, paths or build stamps in either file.

### D6. One library entry point in Editor.Mcp; the hosts serve it live [RULED]

`GenerateSceneReference(outExampleXml, outSchemaJson)` lives in Editor.Mcp, the shared tool
library both hosts register, which since the Editor.Project split (2026-09-27) stands on
the headless project half and already links the pipeline registries, the scene surface's
composition and the resource layer - everything the join of D4 needs. The recorder of D1 is
a serializer backend and lives in Foundation beside the other backends; the generator calls
`RegisterAllSceneComponentReflection()` and composes the scratch scene through
`engine::AddAllSceneManagers`.

Consumers, in the order they land:

1. **The MCP hosts, live (now).** Each host generates the pair in memory from its own
   registrations at startup and serves `docs://generated/SceneExample.scene.xml`
   (`application/xml`) and `docs://generated/SceneSchema.json` (`application/json`) beside
   the `*.md` listing of `RegisterShippingDocResources`. True to the running binary by
   construction: no build step, no staged file, nothing to drift. A `component_schema` tool
   answers one type's entry by wire name or type name from the same model (P3 folded in).
2. **Pregeneration and tracking (later, when wanted).** A tool mode
   (`Tools.Export --emit-scene-reference <dir>`, which stands on Editor.Project) as a
   post-build command, a checked-in copy under `Documentation/Shipping/Generated/` and the
   golden test that fails until it is regenerated, and the dist scripts staging
   `Documentation/Shipping` beside the executables (which they do not today - see "Found
   along the way"). The ruling deferred these; the live surface does not depend on them.

### D7. Hand-written docs keep what does not drift

`Scenes.md` explains concepts only: what entities, components, settings blocks, prefab
instances and script overrides ARE, and the validate-first workflow. For anything exact it
points at the two generated resources, and it carries no inline XML. While here, it takes
three corrections found during this research:
- The settings blocks are `physics, environment, postprocess, navigation, sceneScript`, not
  "physics, post-processing, audio" (`Documentation/Shipping/Scenes.md:26-29`).
- A stale data version fails the WHOLE scene load, not one record with a warning.
- `McpGuide.md` names the generated resources in its "first moves" list.

## Found along the way (fix in P2, cited)

- `scene_validate`'s tool description says its check is "STRUCTURAL"
  (`Code/Editor/Editor.Mcp/SceneTools.cppm:240`). Its file header (:11) and `Scenes.md` say
  payloads are validated in full. The description should match what the tool does.
- `LocateShippingDocs` accepts a `KnownIssues.md` staged beside the executable, but no build
  or dist script stages the docs directory (`scripts/build-editor-dist.sh:70-95` copies
  binaries and `Data/Assets` only). A distributed host therefore serves no `docs://` at all.
  The generated reference makes that gap sharper; P2 stages `Documentation/Shipping` with it.

## Phases

- **P0: the recorder and the schema model** (Foundation; M).
  - `SchemaRecorder` (an `ISerializer` backend in write mode) and the schema model.
  - Tests:
    - a body's recorded order and kinds match its `Serialize` (RigidBody: `motion` is `u8`
      with enum names; `mass` comes last);
    - nesting of objects and arrays, `Text` and guid fields;
    - the `dataVersions` chain recorded for RigidBody is
      `{FNV("rtti::engine::physics::RigidBodyComponent"), 3}`.
- **P0b: the reference hop** (Core, Resource, Pipeline; S).
  - `ReferenceOps::Target()`; `IResourceFactory::CookedType()` on every factory.
  - Tests: the target of `Ref<StaticMesh>` is StaticMesh's type; the tripwire that every
    registered factory's cooked type is some builder's product.
- **P1: the generator and the live surface** (Editor.Mcp; M).
  - `GenerateSceneReference` over the composed scratch scene: every component manager and
    settings system, the joins of D3, the reference chain of D4, the example of D2 with the
    determinism of D5.
  - `docs://generated/*` on both hosts, generated at startup; `component_schema`.
  - Tests:
    - `physics` settings list `groupNames` and report it unreflected;
    - an `EntityRef` field is annotated `ref: entity`; a `Ref<StaticMesh>` field
      `ref: {resource, asset}`;
    - the script override section's worked hash equals `ScriptPropertyNameHash` of its name;
    - the example loads through `LoadScene` into a fully composed scene with an ok status,
      and `scene_validate` on it is valid with no warnings;
    - two generations are byte identical;
    - `resources/list` on the stdio host includes both generated resources and reading them
      returns the generator's bytes; `component_schema("light")` returns the light's entry.
  - The `Scenes.md` rewrite of D7 and the `scene_validate` description fix.
- **P2 (later): pregeneration and tracking.** The tool mode, the checked-in copy and its
  golden test, and the dist staging of `Documentation/Shipping`.

## Acceptance

- An agent with only the MCP can write a valid scene containing any component or settings
  block, using `docs://generated/*` (or `component_schema`) and no probe.
- The served reference is generated by the running host from its own registrations, so it
  cannot describe a different build.
- Both files are byte identical across two runs and both compilers.
- Later, with P2: a wire change fails the golden test until the checked-in reference is
  regenerated in the same commit.
- Green on clang and gcc; ASAN clean for the new tests.

## As built (2026-09-27)

- `SchemaRecorder` (Core, `:schema_recorder`) records through the real write path;
  `ReferenceOps::Target()` and `IResourceFactory::CookedType()` on every factory (27) with the
  tripwire that each cooked type is some builder's product; the generator, the two
  `docs://generated/*` resources and `component_schema` in Editor.Mcp
  (`:scene_reference`, registered by `RegisterEngineTools`, so both hosts serve them);
  `ProjectSession::resources` is the factory seam the editor host fills.
- **The wire writes array elements inline**, with no scope of their own: a struct element
  is the run of its keyed fields (the run repeats from its first key), a scalar, string or
  guid element one unkeyed value. Only component and settings records open one object per
  record. The schema says so in `format.arrays` and gives each array an `element` (the first
  element's fields) when the default has one; an array empty at default has only its
  `elementType`, when reflection knows it. A struct field written through the generic path
  (a `ScriptPropertyValue`) also writes its fields inline under the parent, without a key:
  the override record on the wire is `nameHash, kind, <payload>`, and the schema shows that.
- **The join reads declarations, not live factories** (since engine-composition.md, the same
  day): a `Ref<T>`'s runtime type is joined to the factory DESCRIPTION the engine composition
  carries for it (its cooked form), then to the builder. Every host, the stdio one included,
  resolves every asset type; the first cut's "resource name alone" case no longer arises and
  `ProjectSession::resources` is gone.
- The schema is recorded over the DEFAULTS (D1) before the example scene gets its script
  behaviour, so the script component's `behaviors` shows as an empty array in the schema and
  the example carries the filled behaviour; the `scriptOverrides` section documents the
  record and each kind's payload key from the value's own Serialize, one kind at a time
  (the kind table is `ScriptPropertyTypeNames()`, the one table the parser reads too).
- No prefab instance in the example: the composition has no prefab asset to instance. The
  `prefabInstances` section is present and empty; its record shape is a P2 item together
  with the golden test.
- Nested math values (`Float3`, `Color`, ...) have no reflected fields, so their components
  are not counted as unreflected; only a type that reflects SOME property has its missing
  keys listed. First findings from the lists: `instances`/`tints` (instanced mesh),
  `points` (spline), `groupNames`/`groupCollides` (physics), `overrides` (scene script).

## For the Beef port (Sedulous)

The OUTPUTS are the contract: the two file names, the JSON shape of `SceneSchema.json`, the
docs:// URIs, the golden test's rule, and the build step's placement. Sedulous produces the
same files by its own means:
- Its serializable metadata is comptime rather than runtime reflection, so the join of D3 and
  the resource target of D4 may come straight from comptime data; its factories and builders
  declare the same cooked-type link.
- The generator's home is its Editor.Mcp equivalent, which must stand on the mirrored
  Editor.Project split first.
- Its components with hand-written `Serialize` bodies still need the recording backend of D1,
  since the rule "the write path is the truth" holds in both engines.
