Backend-neutral, reflection-driven gameplay scripting. A language backend is a LIBRARY,
never the architecture: the neutral contract exposes the ENTIRE engine reflection surface
to any backend for free, and a backend is "done" only when the shared conformance battery
is green. Two backends are certified and independently switchable (see
[[script-backend-gating]]): **AngelScript** and **Luau** (the go-forward primary). Wren was
the neutrality-proving first backend and was RETIRED 2026-08-19 (1b220034) once it had
served that purpose - historical mentions in older specs refer to it.

## Architecture (the neutral contract - `foundation.script`)

- `IScriptManager` / `IScriptContext` - VM-agnostic; everything crosses as `Variant` +
  `TypeInfo`. `ScriptObject::Invoke(method, Span<Variant>)` calls a script method;
  `IScriptErrorHandler` carries kind/module/line/message; per-context host services
  (`SetService(type, ptr)`) resolve subsystem pointers per VM (no process globals).
- `RegisterReflectedTypes(manager)` emits the whole reflection registry into a backend in
  one call. Facades are ordinary reflected classes, so a new backend inherits the full
  engine API from reflection.
- **Backend registry** (`ScriptBackendRegistry`): `{languageId, displayName, fileExtensions,
  factory}`; resolves a backend by language id or file extension. No consumer names a
  concrete backend type. `CreateScriptManagerForLanguage(id)` is the resolve entry point.
- **Conformance battery** (`Code/Foundation/Script.Tests/BackendConformance.h`): a shared
  doctest battery every registered backend must pass - reflected-type emission (incl.
  statics on constructible classes), Variant round-trips, per-context services +
  `CurrentScriptContext` nesting, error propagation, GC hook, and the optional-capability
  sections. A backend is certified when the battery is green, not "hopefully".
- **Capability flags** (`ScriptCapabilities`, reported by `IScriptManager::Capabilities()`):
  Coroutines, Delegates, Bytecode, Debugger. The MANAGER is the single source of truth -
  consumers with a backend in hand ask it. AngelScript + Luau: all four
  (Coroutines+Delegates+Bytecode+Debugger).
- **Two-phase type registration** (the AngelScript rule): `RegisterType` COLLECTS;
  `IScriptManager::FinalizeTypes()` (called by `RegisterReflectedTypes`, and defensively
  before the first `CreateContext`) does declare-all-types-then-bind-all-members. A backend
  may defer all emission to finalize (AngelScript needs it; Luau finalizes lazily).
  Facade authors write against the contract, not a backend quirk (`builder.Constructor()`
  is part of the documented contract).

## Tiers + the run host (`engine.script`)

Three tiers, all built. The run host (`ScriptRunHost`) resolves the backend from
`ScriptClass.language` - the whole stack is backend-neutral.

- **Game** (project orchestrator, the scripted `IApplication` counterpart): a `Game` class
  driven `new()` / `launch()` / `update(dt)` / `exit()`, coordinating ABOVE scenes.
- **Level** (per-scene): a `Level` class with `onStart`/`onUpdate`/`onFixedUpdate`/`onStop`,
  bound to a value-facade Scene.
- **Behavior** (per-entity): scripts ticked under simulation. This is the main surface.

**One gameplay context per run** (locked): a run owns ONE `IScriptContext` hosting the game
script + all behavior instances (shared module space). The FIRST-loaded behavior locks the
run's language; a behavior in a different language is refused and disabled
(`EnsureContext`/`WarnLanguageMismatchOnce`) - mixing languages in one run is by design not
supported. Stop tears the context down (isolation is between RUNS, the PIE rule).

## Entity behaviors

- **`ScriptComponent`** (serializable, value-pool, one per entity): an ordered array of
  `Behavior{ script: Ref<ScriptClass>, enabled, overrides: [{nameHash, Variant}] }` plus a
  runtime `ScriptObject` instance. Execution order = array order; cross-entity order is
  unspecified. Prefab members work via the component-granular delta machinery (overrides
  live in the payload).
- **Authoring idiom** is shape-identical across backends, spelled in each language's OOP: a
  constructor takes the owner (`new(entity)` / Level `new(scene)` / Game `new()`), then
  handlers dispatch by presence (`onStart`/`onUpdate(dt)`/`onFixedUpdate(dt)`/`onEnable`/
  `onDisable`/`onDestroy`, plus event handlers). Ticking is simulation-gated
  (`OnlyWhenSimulating`); optional per-behavior `updateInterval` throttles.
- **Properties**: declared per language (AngelScript typed member fields + `[metadata]`;
  Luau instance fields walked from the constructed table).
  The **cook harvests** them (compile the class in the cook VM, construct + walk / read the
  typed members), so the editor renders the inspector with NO VM. Editor values are stored
  as name-HASHED override blobs (rename-safe) and re-applied after hot reload.
- **Hot reload** (edit during play/simulate): resource reload -> per-instance re-instantiate
  -> re-apply hashed overrides; old-instance coroutines stop. (Live-value migration is a
  deferred follow-up - see [[Backlog/scripting-followups]].)

## Events into scripts

- **Physics**: `onContactBegin/End(other, point, normal, speed)`, `onTriggerEnter/Exit`.
  Script does NOT depend on physics - a composition-root `ScriptContactBridge`
  (`DefaultApplication` owns it) resolves an entity-packed body user word to the exact
  entity and dispatches.
- **entity.send**: `entity.send("heal", amount)` invokes `onHeal(amount)` on every behavior
  of the target that declares it. Delivery is DEFERRED (queued + drained at the tick's top
  level - re-entrant VM calls are unsafe). Payload is a single `Variant`, not N overloads
  (see [[overloaded-name-contract]]).
- **Event bus**: `emit(name, payload)` -> `on<Event>` (NATIVE name-keyed bus, C++-first;
  `foundation.messaging`). ONE bus per run scope (messaging.md): a GameInstance owns its run bus and
  injects it into every scene it creates, so `scene.events` and the run bus are the SAME object - a
  behavior's emit reaches the Game tier with NO relay. A bare/edit scene is its own scope (owned
  fallback bus). The owning scope drains once per frame; borrowing scenes never drain it.
- **Delegates**: `IScriptDelegate` wraps a script function as a native callback (certified
  both typed backends; the `DelegateSignal` facade uses it), with a Detach-on-teardown
  protocol.
- **Coroutines** (all backends): `startCoroutine` / `waitSeconds` / `waitUntil`, resumed by
  `AdvanceCoroutines` and cancelled per-instance on destroy/disable (and on entity
  deactivation - [[entity-active-state]]). AngelScript + Luau use pooled resumable
  contexts/threads.

## Engine API surface (facades)

The reflection registry exposes every reflected type. On top, a curated gameplay facade set
(`foundation.script.facades` + per-subsystem facades, kept OUT-OF-TREE per [[facade-pattern]]):
`entity` (transform/name/destroy/findChild/components), `Scene.spawn(prefab, transform)` /
`Scene.find`, `Input`, `Audio`, `Physics.rayCast`, `UI`, `Net`, `Log`, `Time`, `Random`. Rule:
a facade lands only WITH a sample that uses it (no API-first surface). Write facades with
natural C++ types (i32/i64), not f64 ([[script-facade-numerics]]). `Engine.ScriptSurface`
(`RegisterAllScriptFacades`) is the composition root for the complete bound surface.

## Cook + runtime resources

- **`ScriptClass`** (cooked product, `foundation.script.resource`): source text + harvested
  metadata (className, properties, declared handler set, `sourceName`, version) + optional
  cooked **bytecode**.
- **Per-language cook** (`IScriptLanguageCook` / `ScriptLanguageCookRegistry`): compile-check
  (surfaces file/line cook errors), harvest properties/handlers, emit tier starters. The
  cook fingerprint includes the vendored Luau version (Luau bytecode is not stable across
  versions).
- **Bytecode consumed at runtime** (Luau + AngelScript): the run host LOADS the cooked
  bytecode instead of recompiling source. Luau loads each class's blob as its own chunk;
  AngelScript LoadByteCode's each class into its own module (`CreateInstance`/`FindFunction`
  search all owned modules newest-first). Debug info + section names are preserved, so
  breakpoints line up on bytecode-loaded classes.

## Debugger

In-process step debuggers for **AngelScript and Luau** (breakpoints, step into/over, call
stack, locals, capture-object expand), driven through the run host with game-pause
(`IsDebugPaused` gates the tick) and editor UI (breakpoint gutter + call-stack/locals panel).
Suspension-based, non-blocking. Full detail: [[Systems/script-debugger]].

## Editor

- **ScriptPage**: edit source -> recook -> hot reload, with inline error surfacing, a bound-API
  browser (`ScriptApiBrowserView`) + autocomplete driven off `DescribeBoundApi()` (`ScriptApiSurface`).
- **Per-language editor UI** (`Editor.Script.{AngelScript,Luau}`): a CodeEditView lexer
  registered by language id; kept OUT of the UI-free Pipeline layer ([[pipeline-ui-free]]).
- **New-Asset starters**: one creator per registered backend per tier (Behavior/Level/Game),
  seeded from the cook's tier template - e.g. "Luau Behavior". A backend appears only when its
  COOK is registered (the cook registration also registers the backend).

## MCP / tooling

`IScriptManager::DescribeBoundApi()` reports the accurate, backend-reported bound surface
(reflection-vs-backend diff conformance check keeps it honest); the MCP `script_api` tool
reports it per language. See [[mcp-track]].
