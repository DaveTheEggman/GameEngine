# GitHub issues triage (2026-08-08, user-filed)

Nine issues, triaged with code-grounded diagnoses where possible. Cross-refs
into smoketest-fixes.md where they overlap. Same rules as every spec
(CONVENTIONS.md binding; each item lands independently with tests).

## I1. Physics bodies only exist after scene start -> editor debug draw impossible pre-Simulate - CONFIRMED + supersedes smoketest-fixes #4's optimism

Verified: `PhysicsSceneSystem` builds bodies at `OnSceneStarted`, tears down
at `OnSceneStopped` (PhysicsSubsystem.cppm ~5, ~130). So in the editor
BEFORE Simulate there is no world content and `DrawPhysicsDebug` (which
draws FROM the world) has nothing to draw - by construction. The user
additionally reports nothing draws EVEN DURING Simulate, so there are two
distinct fixes:

- **Editor-time collider visualization must draw from COMPONENT DATA, not
  the world** (the way engines draw collider gizmos): a new editor-side
  draw pass over RigidBody/Character/Joint components (shape kind + extents
  + entity transform -> wireframes; no Jolt objects needed). Lives with the
  editor scene page (or an editor-only system), keyed to the viewport
  show-flag proposed in smoketest-fixes #4. This works in ALL modes,
  including pre-Simulate - which is when authoring actually needs it.
- **The Simulate-path bug: ROOT-CAUSED + FIXED (Fable 2026-08-18,
  6dbdfbf7)** - neither of the suspects below. The task-#118 camera-preview
  change made keyed views (the editor viewport) draw ONLY their per-view
  DebugView list, either/or against the per-scene DebugScene list - so the
  edit viewport silently dropped ALL scene-level debug draw (physics AND
  navmesh; PIE renders unkeyed, hence it worked there). Every view now
  draws global + scene (+ its own view list when keyed); the view list
  still never leaks into the camera preview. Physics debug draw now shows
  in editor Simulate with the scene-settings flag on.
  (Superseded suspicion, kept for the record: frame ordering / the flag
  not reaching the editor scene - both wrong.)
- **The component-data half is SCHEDULED**: week-2026-08-22 (seeded item -
  editor-side domain debug draw), riding that week's gizmo-registration
  seam. This closes I1 when it lands.

## I2. Scene view mouse capture never released - WATCH (one occurrence, hard repro)

**ROOT CAUSE FOUND + FIXED (Fable 2026-08-12, via the capture-transition
instrumentation this entry added):** the leak signature never fired at the
InputSurface level - the stuck grab was the EDITOR CAMERA's Tab-capture
(OS relative mouse mode). Its only off-switch (camera Update) ran inside
`if (viewportActive)`, and relative mode makes losing hover/focus easy:
once inactive while captured, the release path could never run again. Fixed
three ways: the page force-releases the moment the viewport goes inactive,
OnClose releases, and Escape releases in flight. SECONDARY observation from
the same log: capture-transition lines print DOUBLED - two open pages each
run an InputRouter over the shared surfaces; benign per the watchdog, but
worth a single-router pass when input work next opens.

Not diagnosable from one occurrence. Action now: add capture/release
instrumentation - the viewport input surface logs (debug level) every
capture acquire/release with the reason, and an ASSERT-level log if a
capture survives N frames with no mouse button down (the leak signature).
Cheap, permanent, and the next occurrence pins the path. Goes in the
stragglers watch list, not a fix queue.

## I3. Prefab pages: scene settings + Level script visibility - DESIGN DECISION (user second-guessed; here is the resolution)

The user's second thought is right that scene settings are USEFUL while
editing a prefab (preview how it behaves when instantiated). The clean
resolution separates PERSISTENCE from VISIBILITY:

- ALL scene-settings sections (INCLUDING the Level script slot - user
  decision, revising the earlier hide-it lean) stay visible in prefab
  pages as EDITOR-PREVIEW state: edits affect the page's preview scene
  only and are NEVER serialized into the prefab wire (a prefab
  instantiated into a real scene inherits THAT scene's settings). One
  clear banner over the whole settings block: "Preview only - not saved
  with the prefab". The Level slot under this framing is a preview TOOL:
  attach a test scene script and Simulate to watch it drive/spawn the
  prefab - no trap, because nothing here pretends to persist.
- PERSIST the preview settings as per-asset EDITOR-side state (the
  material-page preview-shape precedent - sticks per asset, lives in
  editor state, never in the wire) so closing/reopening the prefab page
  resumes the same test setup. The no-editor-data-in-runtime rule is the
  boundary: editor state file, never the prefab.
- The user's "separate view settings for the editor viewport" instinct is
  the show-flags direction already in motion (Post + the Physics flag from
  smoketest-fixes #4) - per-viewport editor-side toggles, distinct from
  authored scene settings. No new mechanism needed; keep extending
  show-flags.
- Tests: prefab save/load round-trip proves preview-edited settings do NOT
  land in the wire; the section-visibility rules unit-tested where the
  page composes its sections.

## I4. Memory: closed scene keeps memory; project open balloons - TWO ITEMS

- **(a) Scene close does not release resources - REAL GAP.** The
  ResourceManager cache holds every product forever (handles cached by id,
  never evicted - by design for reuse, but nothing ever frees). Fix in two
  steps: (1) INSTRUMENT first - a memory report (Project > diagnostics or
  a console command) listing live products by type with sizes, so "what is
  holding it" is answerable (composes with I5's allocator tagging); (2)
  EVICTION: on scene close, products whose handles have no outside refs
  (proxy refcount == cache-only) are released through the existing
  graveyard/retire discipline (GPU objects respect frames-in-flight). An
  explicit "Purge unused resources" action lands first (safe, user-driven),
  automatic on-close eviction after it proves out.
- **(b) Project open eager cost - PARTLY EXPECTED, verify the boundary.**
  Opening scans the content DB (instance headers - cheap) but must NOT
  decode products or import sources until something binds them. Verify with
  (a)'s report what is actually resident after a cold project open;
  thumbnails and auto-cook checks are the likely legitimate consumers. Fix
  anything found decoding full products at open; document the rest as
  expected.
  - CODE FINDING (Fable 2026-08-11): the scan reads only 3 header fields
    (ContentModule ScanInstance) - but the XML serializer factory
    DOM-PARSES THE WHOLE envelope before the first field read, so the
    scan's true cost is full-file parse per envelope (TRANSIENT, freed
    after scan - startup time + peak spikes, not residency). Residency is
    (a)'s never-evicting cache. Candidate fix for (b): streaming partial
    XML parse that stops after the header (preferred - no staleness
    class), vs bounded-prefix parse, vs a generated header index file.

- **ROOT CAUSE FOUND + FIXED (Fable 2026-08-11, via the HeavyProject repro):**
  neither (a) nor (b) was the 5-GB driver. The model importer wrote mesh
  GEOMETRY INLINE in the XML envelope - Sponza produced a 170 MB
  mesh.0.xasset, and every project open DOM-parsed it to read 3 header
  fields (25 s freeze; ~5 GB of DOM small-allocs the allocator never
  returns; resource cache held ONE product the whole time). FIX: mesh
  asset v3 - geometry moves to a BINARY sidecar stream ("geometry", via
  BinarySerializer under the asset's version scope), envelope = metadata +
  flag; legacy inline (v<3) still loads; builders declare the stream in
  sourceStreams so geometry edits still dirty the cook. MEASURED on the
  repro: envelope 170,518,290 B -> 422 B (+13 MB binary sidecar - the XML
  text encoding was also 13x fatter than binary); open scan 163 MB -> 655
  KB; editor RSS 5,081 MB -> 327 MB. Existing projects convert on
  re-import (delete the imported group + import again); until then the
  legacy path loads correctly but slowly. RULE: bulk machine-generated
  data NEVER goes inline in text envelopes - sidecar streams (the
  texture-pixels precedent, now the mesh precedent too).
  (a) eviction and (b) partial header parse remain OPEN as real-but-
  smaller items - the instrumentation below prices them now.

- **INSTRUMENTATION SHIPPED (step 1, Fable 2026-08-11):**
  ResourceManager::ReportLiveProducts (counts by product type; the
  `unreferenced` column = cache-only handles = exactly what a purge would
  release - RefCount()==1 on the cached handle) surfaced as
  Project > Report Resource Memory; ContentDatabase::LastScanStats
  (envelopes + bytesOpened) logged at every project open. Next: run both
  against the user's repro project; the numbers pick (a)-vs-(b) priority.

## I5. Allocator plumbing: everything uses DefaultAllocator at call site - ARCHITECTURAL TRACK (own pace)

True today (DefaultAllocator() at ~every construction site). This is a
code-standard-cleanup-scale track, not a bug fix:
- Phase it exactly like the code-standard cleanup: Core-up, module by
  module; each system/subsystem takes an `IAllocator&` at construction -
  REQUIRED, NOT DEFAULTED (user directive: failure must be loud and fixed
  immediately; a DefaultAllocator() fallback parameter would just relocate
  the ambient-allocator problem one level up). Each module phase is
  therefore a compile-breaking sweep: the signature changes and every call
  site in that phase is updated EXPLICITLY in the same commit, passing a
  real allocator decision down from its owner.
- The PAYOFF making it worth doing now rather than someday: per-system
  tagged allocators feed I4's memory accounting (who owns what becomes a
  report, not a hunt).
- Do NOT thread allocators through hot per-frame paths that never allocate
  steady-state (rings, pools) beyond their construction.
- Each module phase: behavior-identical, both compilers, ASAN green; the
  tag report grows a row per converted system.

## I6. Texture compression missing - SPECCED 2026-08-15, see Documentation/Specs/asset-variants.md

> The sketch below is SUPERSEDED by the full spec (per-target variant axis +
> BCn/ASTC encoders, both dependencies user-approved). Kept for history.

Real gap: imported textures stay raw RGBA; cooking does no platform
processing. Track shape:
- P1: BCn encode at IMPORT for desktop (BC1 opaque / BC3 alpha / BC5
  normals / BC7 quality knob) stored in the cooked texture product;
  TextureResource already carries format - the GPU factory uploads
  compressed as-is. NEEDS A THIRD-PARTY ENCODER (bc7enc/ispc_texcomp
  class) - USER APPROVAL REQUIRED before adding the dependency (vendored,
  per the SDL precedent).
- P2: cook-time PLATFORM axis: desktop keeps BCn; Web preset transcodes
  per the earlier decision (desktop-browser BC ok; mobile ASTC/ETC2 is the
  export-knob future noted in the web track).
- Import dialog gains the compression choice (+ "None" escape); existing
  projects re-import on demand, no forced migration.
- Tests: encode round-trip (PSNR floor per format), cooked-product format
  assertions, player renders a BC-cooked texture (backend probe).

## I7. Audio clip page: pause + volume; runtime volume API - SMALL

- Clip audition page gains Pause (toggles with Play) and a volume slider
  (audition-local gain, not persisted).
- The ACTUAL ask (clarified): a volume control for the EDITOR's embedded
  runtime audio - editing/previewing with game audio blasting needs an
  editor-side knob. Add a master-volume control for the embedded runtime's
  audio engine surfaced in the editor (Game tab toolbar or Preferences,
  persisted as EDITOR state - never project data), applied to the
  engine-level master gain so it covers Simulate, Game tab, and audition
  alike.
- Secondary (only if absent, since it falls out of the same engine knob):
  expose `Audio.setMasterVolume` on the script facade. Battery case if
  added; skip if the bus layout already gives games the control they need.

## I8. Exported player colors wrong (Linux) - ROOT CAUSE UNCONFIRMED (user retesting); harden the swapchain fallback regardless

`VkSwapChainImpl::chooseSurfaceFormat` (VkSwapChain.cppm ~200) falls back
desired -> B8G8R8A8_SRGB -> **B8G8R8A8_UNORM -> fmts[0]** with NO
logging. If the dist machine's surface (different WSI/driver than the dev
box) lacks the sRGB format, the player silently renders into a UNORM
target while the pipeline assumes encode-on-write -> washed output. The
user flags this may NOT be the reported issue (retest pending) - but the
silent fallback is a real hazard on its own and the logging directly
answers the issue's own question ("what is the swapchain format?"). Do
regardless of the retest outcome:
- LOG the negotiated surface format at startup (both the request and the
  result) - turns the next report into a one-line diagnosis.
- On a non-sRGB fallback, the final pass must encode manually (the tonemap
  already has an encode path variant on web - reuse the decision point) OR
  the fallback is refused with a clear error if manual encode is
  impractical on that path. Prefer adapt-and-log.
- The user retests the color issue on the affected machine WITH the format
  log in hand and reports; if the log shows an sRGB swapchain, the hunt
  moves elsewhere (tonemap output path, exported-content color space) with
  the fallback hazard closed either way.

## I10. Windows OpenPathInFileManager: normalize separators - TRIVIAL, exact fix known

The user pinned it: forward-slash paths reach `explorer.exe "<path>"` and
Explorer refuses them. In the Win32 backend, before building the command:
copy the path and flip every '/' to '\\' (bounded by the existing 4096
buffer; reject overlong instead of truncating mid-path). Test: unit-test
the normalization helper (mixed separators, UNC-ish inputs, overlong);
the launch itself stays manual-verify on Windows.

## Suggested order

I10 (trivial) -> I8 hardening (log + adapt; arms the user's retest) -> I1 +
smoketest-fixes #4 together (one physics-debug story) -> I3 (design, small)
-> I7 -> I4a instrument -> I2 instrumentation -> then the tracks: I4
eviction, I6 compression (after dependency approval), I5 allocators
(paced, loud-breakage sweeps). (MSVC setup removed from this doc - the user
runs that separately on Windows.)


## I11. Scene-pass MSAA (quality gap vs Godot's default) - RENDERER BACKLOG

Surfaced by the Sponza side-by-side (2026-08-12): Godot looks better by
DEFAULT partly because its 3D pass is MSAA'd; ours is single-sampled with
post AA only (TAA/FXAA). Geometry-edge quality without TAA's temporal
artifacts needs real MSAA: multisampled color+depth targets through the
frame graph, resolves feeding the post stack, sample-state across the
forward + depth-prepass + debug-draw pipelines, and a quality setting
(off/2x/4x). Note the interaction: MSAA + HDR + the prepass/motion-vector
consumers all resolve-aware. The OTHER half of the same comparison (no
mips) was the dominant term and is FIXED (texture cook v2 generates full
chains; model imports default mips ON + trilinear); MSAA is the remaining
polish. Belongs to the renderer track alongside the post-stack work. SPEC WRITTEN (2026-08-12): Documentation/Specs/msaa.md - decisions settled (per-view, 4x web ceiling, MSAA prepass + first-sample depth resolve for the 1x post consumers, single end-of-forward resolve, MSAA/TAA independent); ready for Opus.

## WebGpuDevice::Destroy misses device-internal objects (small leak) - CLOSED 2026-08-25

Found by the pass-16 ASAN sweep over Engine.Terrain.Backend.Tests
(2026-08-24): after fixing the probe-side leaks (encoders, Readback's
encoder, un-Cleared height caches), each WEBGPU device lifetime leaked
device-internal objects at teardown.

RESOLUTION: by the 2026-08-25 sweep the blit-texture/render-bundle leaks
originally suspected were already gone (fixed with the pass-16 cleanup);
the one remaining engine-side leak was the deliberate per-device
`LostRoute` heap record in WebGpuAdapter::CreateDevice (the device-lost
callback's userdata, marked as an intentional leak because the callback
could outlive every safe free point). Fixed by handing the record to the
wrapper (WebGpuDevice::AdoptLostRoute): Destroy frees it AFTER releasing
the wgpu device and flushing pending callbacks via
wgpuInstanceProcessEvents - the orderly-teardown callback (reason
Destroyed) never dereferences the route, and a real-loss callback queued
earlier is delivered by the flush, so no callback can read the route
after the free. Verified: the Backend-tests ASAN run now reports ZERO
leak frames in engine code - everything remaining is libdbus inside the
driver stack (not ours).
