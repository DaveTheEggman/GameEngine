# Import workflow - the review-and-commit import dialog

> STATUS 2026-08-31: P1 SHIPPED (37b44451) for the MODEL importer -

> resource list (check-all, per-row enable + rename) + prepare-first flow
> reusing the worker payload at commit. NOT yet: previews, batch/multi-file

> DRAFT for discussion (user + Fable, 2026-08-31). Nothing here is scheduled;

## The problem

Import today is single-shot and blind: drop a file, maybe pick an importer
(one modal per file), set a handful of pre-toggles you can't see the
consequences of, and the importer fans out everything with source-derived
names (`CUBezierCurve.000`, 19 `CharacterArmature_*` clips) into the group.
No preview, no per-resource choice, no renaming, and a 10-file drop is 10
disconnected sequences.

## The shape: prepare -> review -> commit

The pipeline already separates PREPARE from commit (`IFileImporter` has a
`prepared` object). The plan builds the missing middle: a review dialog fed
by prepare output, committing only what was approved.

1. **Prepare** (per source file, off the UI thread via the job service):
   parse the source, produce a MANIFEST of would-be resources - kind, source
   name, proposed target name, dependencies (material -> its textures) -
   with NO content-DB writes.
2. **Review** (the dialog, one session for the whole drop):
   - RULING (user + Fable 2026-08-31): ONE dialog per drop, ALWAYS - no
     per-type dialogs, no tabs, no no-dialog fast path for single files
     (almost any file can import as several asset types, so the type choice
     is part of every import; a single file is just a one-row session, and
     "import with defaults" keeps it one click).
   - Left: source-file list (the batch), grouped into SECTIONS by resolved
     importer ("Models (2) / Textures (5) / Audio (1)"). A mixed-type drop
     is therefore the same dialog as a homogeneous one. Per-file importer
     dropdown where the extension is ambiguous - this REPLACES the
     modal-per-file chooser; changing it moves the row into that importer's
     section. Selecting a section header (or multi-select) sets the
     importer / applies a preset for all rows at once.
   - The DETAIL panes (center + right) adapt to the selected file's
     importer - model shows the resource tree + 3D preview, texture its
     options + flat preview, audio its options. One dialog, one selection
     model, one commit; per-importer detail panes (the inspector's
     per-component-editor idiom).
   - Center: resource tree for the selected source, grouped by kind
     (Meshes / Materials / Textures / Skeleton / Clips / Generated:
     prefab, scene, collision, LODs). Checkbox per item AND per group
     (today's blind toggles become the group checkboxes). Editable target
     name per item. Inline collision warning when a name exists in the
     target group.
   - Right: preview pane for the selection - 3D orbit for model/meshes
     (PreviewViewport, the bespoke-page machinery), flat view for textures,
     clips playable on the model (per-scene simulation gate already allows
     this).
   - Batch rename rules over a selection: strip prefix, find/replace,
     prefix/suffix. This is the real fix for 19 clips - per-item editing is
     the fallback, not the workflow.
3. **Commit**: import the checked set under the chosen names into the target
   group. Progress per file; failures leave the rest of the batch alone.

## Batch efficiency (many models at once)

- ONE dialog session for an N-file drop; per-file review is optional, not
  forced. "Import all with defaults" stays one click - the dialog must never
  make the simple case slower.
- **Presets are RULE SETS, not flat settings** (ruling, user + Fable
  2026-08-31, from the terrain-set case: a drop of diffuse + displacement +
  heightmap + masks needs DIFFERENT settings per file, so "apply one
  setting to all" is the failure mode). A preset = named rules (name-token
  -> configuration) + group toggles + rename rules ("Character",
  "Static prop", "Terrain set"). Applying one runs the rules per file.
- **Batch application is SELECTION-scoped, never drop-scoped**: select the
  four masks -> set Data Mask once; per-file editing stays the fallback.
- **Name-token inference pre-configures each file at prepare time**:
  pipeline::InferTextureUsage (shipped with the texture-page rework) maps
  _diffuse/_normal/_mask/_height tokens to usage -> color space ->
  compression, so a texture set arrives correctly configured and review is
  a glance. Inference may also suggest the IMPORTER per file (a heightmap
  likely wants the heightfield importer, not texture) - shown in the row's
  dropdown, overridable.
- Previews load LAZILY (selection-driven) - a 100-file drop must open
  instantly.
- Shared settings edit = apply to all selected files; per-file overrides
  win.

## Re-import

The committed choices (checked set, target names, preset, toggles) persist
on the manifest/import options so re-import and prefab regeneration reuse
them without re-asking. Re-import shows the dialog only when the source
grew NEW resources (they arrive checked-or-not per the preset, flagged as
new).

## Model-import options that ride this

- **Merge meshes** (user 2026-08-31): collapse same-skin skinned parts /
  static submeshes into one mesh with submesh material slots. Off by
  default (loses per-part show/hide). Checkbox in the Generated group.
- **Skip joint nodes** (week-2026-08-29 seed): drop pure-joint GLTF nodes
  from generated prefabs/scenes - they are dead weight (the skeleton
  resource carries its own hierarchy). Likely default ON.
- Existing toggles (textures/materials/animations/prefab/scene/collision/
  convex/LODs) migrate into the group checkboxes unchanged.

## Hosting: modal first, utility window later

The dialog content is a HOST-AGNOSTIC view. Phase 1 hosts it in a large
centered modal layer inside the main window (cheap, no new windowing).
A standalone utility window (OS window + own root view, non-dockable) is a
plausible later host - the docking floats prove the shell machinery exists -
but it is a separate windowing deliverable and must not gate the import UI.
(Wayland verification for OS-chromed floats is still owed; don't stack new
platform risk on the import track.)

## Open questions (decide at planning)

- Does prepare load full source content for previews, or a cheap header pass
  first with the preview loaded on selection? (Recommend: cheap manifest at
  open; full load lazily per selection.)
- Where do presets live - per-project settings (per-project store exists) or
  user-global?
- Target-group choice in the dialog, or always the drop-target group?
- Clip preview: play on the imported model in the preview scene - needs the
  prepare-stage model wired to a private preview scene before any assets
  exist. Feasible (runtime model spawn path exists) but the most involved
  preview; ship texture/mesh previews first?
